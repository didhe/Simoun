Dialogue: 0,0:02:23.04,0:02:26.00,Default,,0,0,0,,A Simoun really is totally different from a Simile, isn't it?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:26.50,0:02:27.63,Default,,0,0,0,,I asked you who you were.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:28.21,0:02:29.46,Default,,0,0,0,,And that uniform...?

Dialogue: 0,0:02:43.65,0:02:43.98,Default,,0,0,0,,I understand.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.07,0:02:53.03,Default,,0,0,0,,Helical motors are always found in spiral-shaped pairs like these.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:54.61,0:03:01.20,Default,,0,0,0,,We attach cockpits and various other equipment to control them.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:01.50,0:03:05.62,Default,,0,0,0,,We call the whole a Simoun for the sake of convenience.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:06.54,0:03:07.79,Default,,0,0,0,,Yes, that's right.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:10.80,0:03:12.92,Default,,0,0,0,,We think that this one probably manipulates—
Dialogue: 0,0:03:13.63,0:03:14.34,Default,,0,0,0,,"Probably?"
Dialogue: 0,0:03:14.80,0:03:22.06,Default,,0,0,0,,Yes. We think this one manipulates what you might call a spatial force, which exists throughout the universe.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:22.98,0:03:28.06,Default,,0,0,0,,The other one controls what we would describe as a temporal force.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:28.40,0:03:30.40,Default,,0,0,0,,Is that also "probably?"
Dialogue: 0,0:03:30.98,0:03:32.49,Default,,0,0,0,,Yes. Probably.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:32.90,0:03:38.99,Default,,0,0,0,,In fact, we know almost nothing about the helical motors we've excavated.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:39.66,0:03:40.66,Default,,0,0,0,,All we know is...
Dialogue: 0,0:03:40.87,0:03:42.37,Default,,0,0,0,,...how to use them.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:43.00,0:03:48.21,Default,,0,0,0,,Also, we can only maintain the parts that we've added to the helical motors.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:48.92,0:03:49.79,Default,,0,0,0,,That's the situation.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.75,0:03:51.21,Default,,0,0,0,,I see.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:52.13,0:03:57.47,Default,,0,0,0,,But the Simile were built to investigate the structure of the helical motors, weren't they?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:58.14,0:04:02.97,Default,,0,0,0,,Yes. But you've flown Simile up until now, so you must know how they perform.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:03.85,0:04:07.90,Default,,0,0,0,,Compared to this Simoun, a Simile is nothing but a pale imitation.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:08.48,0:04:09.98,Default,,0,0,0,,They don't deserve to be mentioned in the same breath.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:10.69,0:04:15.28,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, I've heard that nobody's ever taken apart a Simoun.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:16.20,0:04:17.86,Default,,0,0,0,,That seems rather strange.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:18.41,0:04:19.20,Default,,0,0,0,,Strange?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:19.87,0:04:25.37,Default,,0,0,0,,The Simoun are sacred craft built to serve Tempus Spatium in holy rituals.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:26.04,0:04:27.79,Default,,0,0,0,,They must be treated with the proper respect.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.58,0:04:29.83,Default,,0,0,0,,He's right, Morinas.{** he?}
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.50,0:04:34.17,Default,,0,0,0,,We are here to offer Ri Maajons to Tempus Spatium.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:34.92,0:04:36.72,Default,,0,0,0,,We are priestesses serving Tempus Spatium.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:37.72,0:04:39.39,Default,,0,0,0,,Well, I'm not really a priestess.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:39.97,0:04:41.22,Default,,0,0,0,,Then what are you?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:42.22,0:04:44.35,Default,,0,0,0,,I just want to fly a Simoun.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:44.81,0:04:47.23,Default,,0,0,0,,I'm not a priestess. But...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:47.87,0:04:48.21,Default,,0,0,0,,But what?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.52,0:04:53.48,Default,,0,0,0,,I'm not a soldier, either.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:54.11,0:04:55.99,Default,,0,0,0,,Don't you feel the same way, Paraietta?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:58.91,0:05:01.12,Default,,0,0,0,,Oh, Paraietta. This is...?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:01.58,0:05:02.74,Default,,0,0,0,,Her name is Morinas, Floe.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.87,0:05:05.45,Default,,0,0,0,,Oh, that's right! You're Morinas.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:06.75,0:05:07.96,Default,,0,0,0,,Mo-ri-nas.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:08.87,0:05:09.75,Default,,0,0,0,,Good morning, Floe.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.00,0:05:12.50,Default,,0,0,0,,I'm bad at remembering people's names.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:13.05,0:05:13.59,Default,,0,0,0,,And...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:16.34,0:05:21.72,Default,,0,0,0,,Sorry, when I first saw you I thought for a second that you might be Wapourif's new lover.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:22.97,0:05:23.85,Default,,0,0,0,,But there's just no way, huh?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:27.73,0:05:30.27,Default,,0,0,0,,My windshield is creaking. Can you take a look at it?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:30.65,0:05:31.65,Default,,0,0,0,,Certainly!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:32.61,0:05:37.19,Default,,0,0,0,,I'd appreciate it if you could tell her more about the differences between the Simile and the Simoun this afternoon.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:37.78,0:05:38.74,Default,,0,0,0,,That won't be a problem.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.36,0:05:44.78,Default,,0,0,0,,If there's anything you'd like to know about the Simoun, or about this ship, come and ask us any time.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:45.49,0:05:46.04,Default,,0,0,0,,Thanks.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:51.71,0:05:53.17,Default,,0,0,0,,Wait up! I'm coming too.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.13,0:05:56.13,Default,,0,0,0,,So, did you learn much, Morinas?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:56.96,0:06:00.05,Default,,0,0,0,,Hopefully this afternoon I'll be able to learn something interesting.

Dialogue: 0,0:07:56.67,0:07:59.09,Default,,0,0,0,,I'm glad that you came back from the Spring.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:00.25,0:08:05.55,Default,,0,0,0,,May I take it that you have chosen to remain a Simoun sibylla?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:06.34,0:08:08.55,Default,,0,0,0,,I'm not sure yet. And...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:10.01,0:08:10.55,Default,,0,0,0,,And?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:11.97,0:08:14.39,Default,,0,0,0,,I don't have a pair any more.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:14.89,0:08:17.40,Default,,0,0,0,,Nevertheless, you have returned.

Dialogue: 0,0:08:34.62,0:08:38.29,Default,,0,0,0,,We always gather in the ballroom after breakfast.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:38.75,0:08:42.25,Default,,0,0,0,,I see. It's a habit you picked up when you were flying the night shift, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:42.80,0:08:48.18,Default,,0,0,0,,As I was saying, why don't we all get together to do Maaju in the pool this afternoon at three?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:50.68,0:08:51.80,Default,,0,0,0,,You mean all of us?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:52.22,0:08:53.81,Default,,0,0,0,,Is this mandatory?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:55.39,0:08:56.81,Default,,0,0,0,,So, at three o'clock, then?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:57.39,0:08:58.89,Default,,0,0,0,,That sounds great! Let's go in the pool.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:59.23,0:09:00.77,Default,,0,0,0,,Especially since we're now so—oh!
Dialogue: 0,0:09:04.32,0:09:06.40,Default,,0,0,0,,We have lost three of our comrades.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:06.90,0:09:10.07,Default,,0,0,0,,After that, three more left to go to the Spring.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:10.70,0:09:13.45,Default,,0,0,0,,During this crisis, we have been relieved from night duty.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:14.70,0:09:16.08,Default,,0,0,0,,We were the elite.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:16.83,0:09:21.58,Default,,0,0,0,,We will regain our honour as priestesses and as sibyllae.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:22.71,0:09:23.59,Default,,0,0,0,,I'm looking forward to this!
Dialogue: 0,0:09:24.30,0:09:25.30,Default,,0,0,0,,I've just joined,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:25.71,0:09:28.47,Default,,0,0,0,,so it'll be wonderful to do Maaju with a real choir.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:29.09,0:09:31.80,Default,,0,0,0,,And you want to do this at three o'clock, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:32.30,0:09:34.97,Default,,0,0,0,,Why is three o'clock such a big deal?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:35.35,0:09:36.39,Default,,0,0,0,,That's when...
Dialogue: 0,0:09:45.36,0:09:49.40,Default,,0,0,0,,Three o'clock is when Neviril always practices her Maaju.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:54.20,0:09:55.45,Default,,0,0,0,,Sibylla Aurea Neviril!
Dialogue: 0,0:09:56.83,0:09:58.08,Default,,0,0,0,,I am honoured to meet you.

Dialogue: 0,0:10:00.29,0:10:04.59,Default,,0,0,0,,I've just been ordered to join the greatest choir of all, Chor Tempest.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:05.38,0:10:06.13,Default,,0,0,0,,Her name is Morinas.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:08.76,0:10:11.93,Default,,0,0,0,,I see. I hope that you will get along well with the rest of the choir.

Dialogue: 0,0:10:20.98,0:10:24.48,Default,,0,0,0,,Huh? But I thought {\i1}you{\i0} were my pair, Neviril?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:24.94,0:10:27.86,Default,,0,0,0,,Don't be so presumptuous! You've only flown together once.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:28.44,0:10:31.90,Default,,0,0,0,,Don't imagine that you can possibly replace Amuria.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:32.53,0:10:34.41,Default,,0,0,0,,That's enough, Paraietta.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:35.08,0:10:35.45,Default,,0,0,0,,Anyway—

Dialogue: 0,0:10:40.54,0:10:40.91,Default,,0,0,0,,I see.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:41.54,0:10:44.88,Default,,0,0,0,,That's when you do your Maaju, isn't it?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:45.67,0:10:49.00,Default,,0,0,0,,If you haven't chosen your pair yet, please consider me!
Dialogue: 0,0:10:51.63,0:10:56.64,Default,,0,0,0,,Morinas, your pair will come to you naturally during the course of a Maaju.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:57.26,0:10:59.14,Default,,0,0,0,,It's not something you can simply decide beforehand.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:59.73,0:11:03.23,Default,,0,0,0,,I would be honoured to pair with you, Sibylla Aurea.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:04.44,0:11:04.85,Default,,0,0,0,,Indeed.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:36.68,0:11:41.81,Default,,0,0,0,,Don't be afraid. An attack like that could not possibly harm the {\i1}Arcus Prima{\i0}.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:42.14,0:11:43.18,Default,,0,0,0,,Yes, ma'am!
Dialogue: 0,0:11:43.98,0:11:49.48,Default,,0,0,0,,If you want to become Simoun sibyllae, you should walk proudly, without fear.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:50.19,0:11:50.69,Default,,0,0,0,,Understood.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:00.08,0:12:01.74,Default,,0,0,0,,There seem to be quite a lot of those today.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:03.00,0:12:05.37,Default,,0,0,0,,Should we go out and intercept them?
Dialogue: 0,0:12:06.08,0:12:06.83,Default,,0,0,0,,Yeah, let's go!
Dialogue: 0,0:12:07.33,0:12:09.79,Default,,0,0,0,,We're not allowed to fly combat duty at the moment.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:42.70,0:12:45.20,Default,,0,0,0,,Their greetings seem a little too enthusiastic today.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:45.83,0:12:51.13,Default,,0,0,0,,Their long-range shelling is mostly just irritating, but we can't be certain that they won't get lucky.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:51.71,0:12:54.71,Default,,0,0,0,,I believe we may have to consider doing something about it.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:56.05,0:12:57.88,Default,,0,0,0,,Is Chor Tempest still off line?
Dialogue: 0,0:12:59.22,0:13:01.85,Default,,0,0,0,,They can handle being without a few members.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:02.76,0:13:03.64,Default,,0,0,0,,But not Neviril?
Dialogue: 0,0:13:04.14,0:13:09.19,Default,,0,0,0,,Yes. No matter what we do, if she doesn't come back,
Dialogue: 0,0:13:09.19,0:13:11.36,Default,,0,0,0,,Chor Tempest will remain in disarray.
