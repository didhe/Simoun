1
00:00:01,701 --> 00:00:06,039
It's time for the Sibylla Aurea Battle.

2
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:07,374
<i>Monthly! ADR Bulletin Special</i>
<i>Pair Versus Pair Competition!!</i>
It's time for the Sibylla Aurea Battle.

3
00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:10,076
<i>Monthly! ADR Bulletin Special</i>
<i>Pair Versus Pair Competition!!</i>

4
00:00:10,076 --> 00:00:11,338
<i>Monthly! ADR Bulletin Special</i>
<i>Pair Versus Pair Competition!!</i>
We're going...

5
00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:12,078
...to determine which pair is worthy
of being called "Golden Priestesses"...

6
00:00:12,078 --> 00:00:16,538
Mamina
RIKA MORINAGA
...to determine which pair is worthy
of being called "Golden Priestesses"...

7
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:21,243
...and you'll be
competing in teams of two.

8
00:00:21,654 --> 00:00:25,112
After the last round, the pair,
or team, with the most points...

9
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:29,986
...will receive an extremely
valuable prize! Do your best, everyone!

10
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:36,792
Well then, let's have each member
introduce herself and their pair.

11
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:40,338
I'm Michi Niino, and I play Aer.

12
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:42,800
I play Neviril...

13
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:46,803
I play Neviril.
My name is Rieko Takahashi.

14
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:50,371
The pair's name is Lilies of the Valley.

15
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,685
I'm Ami Koshimizu,
and I play Paraietta.

16
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:55,355
I play Kaim. Michiko Hosokoshi.

17
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:57,516
I play Kaim. Michiko Hosokoshi.
What was that?

18
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:58,557
Sorry.

19
00:00:58,658 --> 00:01:00,683
Our pair's name is...

20
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:02,989
...the Mangoes!

21
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:06,527
I'm Mamiko Noto, and I play Rimone.

22
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:08,931
Mikako Takahashi. I play Roatreamon.

23
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:11,196
Our pair's name is...

24
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:13,272
...Monotone!

25
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:14,340
Yay!

26
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:15,931
What's with that?

27
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,737
Black and white.

28
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:20,571
I'm Michiru Aizawa, and I play Floe.

29
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,480
Um... Alty, right?
I'm Megumi Toyoguchi.

30
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,108
Our pair's name is...

31
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:28,779
...Team Green!

32
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:32,014
Copycats! Copycats!

33
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:33,552
Rip-off! Rip-off!

34
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:37,118
Copycats? Yes, but please
root for us anyway.

35
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:42,795
All right, so here they are...
the contestants of this battle.

36
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:52,268
Who's the best couple?

37
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:55,279
Simoun Compatibility Test!

38
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:03,246
So let's start with
a simple word association game.

39
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:06,526
I'll give you
a keyword related to Simoun...

40
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:10,163
...and you each write down
whatever comes to mind...

41
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:13,133
...using those writing boards.

42
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:17,399
Points will be awarded if both
team members give the same answer.

43
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:23,074
All right, I'll give you the first
keyword now, and it is...

44
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:27,569
In your opinion, what's the first
step in becoming an adult?

45
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,911
All right, everybody!
Get your answers ready!

46
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:36,855
Simoun related?

47
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,391
Good luck!

48
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,158
We've been abandoned.

49
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:44,954
From the start.

50
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:47,032
Becoming an adult?

51
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:50,163
It depends if we keep
the story in mind...

52
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,431
Becoming an adult...

53
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:54,574
How are we doing?

54
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:56,542
Ding-ding-ding!

55
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:58,736
All right, now that time's up...

56
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:04,511
Let's hear how Ms. Niino and
Ms. Takahashi, the Lilies, answered.

57
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:06,050
Please show us!

58
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:07,141
Okay.

59
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:13,551
Pretty long! When you start your first
job, start making your own money...

60
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,025
But it's true.

61
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:16,652
Like a part-time job.

62
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:18,560
Very realistic.

63
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:21,133
That's so realistic. A part-time job...

64
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:23,600
She even wrote it down!

65
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,263
Then let's see your answer, Rieko.

66
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:29,569
<i>Love</i>
Ta-da... Totally different.

67
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,744
It's like you're really holding back.

68
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:35,805
It's like you're really holding back.
But still, they're both mature answers.

69
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:37,007
I see.

70
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:40,347
The answers are
totally different, so no-go.

71
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:46,617
Okay, next up... Ami-chan
and Michiko-san, the Mangoes!

72
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:50,685
Why don't you show us at
the same time? Ready, set, go.

73
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:55,063
<i>Shopping alone (running first errand)</i>
<i>Going shopping by yourself</i>

74
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:58,160
Running your first errand too, right?

75
00:03:58,271 --> 00:03:59,568
Amazing!

76
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,800
Unbelievable!

77
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,139
We're definitely a good match, huh?

78
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:13,546
Next up, Mamiko-san and
Meguko-chan, the Monotones.

79
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:15,678
Ready, set, go.

80
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:17,122
Go!

81
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:20,659
<i>20 years old Alcohol</i>

82
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:26,594
That's "you can turn
20 after you drink alcohol"?

83
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:31,128
You can drink alcohol
after you turn 20!

84
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:39,605
Okay, um, nothing doing!

85
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:43,149
No good, no good.
Wrong answer, wrong answer.

86
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:46,277
Okay, next.
It's Michiru-chan and Megu-nee!

87
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:49,479
Go, green team. Ready, set, go.

88
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:53,116
<i>First Kiss (Smack!) Alcohol</i>
Go.

89
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,261
We should pair up.

90
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:56,228
We should pair up.
You can't!

91
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,823
I knew we'd agree on something...
And it had to be this!

92
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:02,864
I guess it's
the generation gap or something...

93
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,028
Yup, to be brutally honest.

94
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:08,198
After all, you can't...
You can't yet, right?

95
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,469
No, I can't drink yet.

96
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,577
Another no-go.

97
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:15,147
Then on to the next question.

98
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,483
Question number two!

99
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:21,385
What makes a woman beautiful?

100
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:25,420
What makes a woman beautiful?

101
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,152
What is beauty?

102
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:31,163
If you please.
Write it down, write it down.

103
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,891
Are you ready?

104
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,729
Okay! We're done!

105
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:41,036
Wait, which page
did I write my answer on?

106
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:43,107
You wrote a lot.

107
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:45,769
Ready? All right, then...

108
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:48,278
Let's start with the Lilies again.

109
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:51,350
Show us your answers.
Ready, set, go.

110
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:56,548
<i>Never bending her will to the very end!</i>
<i>Her purity</i>

111
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:58,454
Wrong!

112
00:05:58,558 --> 00:05:59,718
No good...

113
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:01,851
Okay, next. The Mangoes...

114
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:04,192
Let's go! Ready, set, go.

115
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,802
To always be smiling...

116
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:11,369
Kindness...

117
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,835
Well, they're close.

118
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,000
Smiles equal kindness, right?

119
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:19,839
I don't think they're equal at all.

120
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:23,711
What do you say?

121
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:25,078
Wrong.

122
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:26,811
No good, no good.

123
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:29,183
Next, the Monotones!

124
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:32,022
Ready, set, go.

125
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:33,792
Appearance.

126
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:34,985
Content.

127
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:38,529
Oh, mine means "outside"!

128
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:43,724
So as long as it looks good
on the outside, it's all right.

129
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:45,360
They're opposite.

130
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:49,339
So we should write
the opposite thing from now on.

131
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:55,213
That's another "no-good" answer.

132
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:58,408
All right, Team Green next.

133
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:01,078
Okay, ready, set, go.

134
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:04,920
<i>Neviril-sama Being in love</i>
What kind of answer is that? You
okay?

135
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:09,321
I tried every which way
to come up with a teen's answer.

136
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,226
An answer that evokes youth!

137
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,992
What's up with that answer?
Neviril-sama?

138
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,664
Because she's beautiful.

139
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,294
"All you have to be is beautiful."
("Utsukushikereba soredeii.")

140
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:20,429
Good one!

141
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,030
The theme song.

142
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:24,837
Well, it is a typical Floe answer.

143
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:28,038
Anyway, I guess for this corner...

144
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:31,878
...l'll give the Mangoes
10,000 points or so.

145
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:33,952
10,000?

146
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,582
So anyway...

147
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:42,157
That's it for
the Simoun Compatibility Test!

148
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:53,998
The Super-Difficult Simoun Cult Quiz!

149
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:59,469
Okay, so the rules are very simple.

150
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:02,946
It's a quiz all about
what happens in the show.

151
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,641
I'll read show-related questions...

152
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:10,711
...and I'd like you to write your
answers on the writing boards.

153
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:15,084
So let's get started. Question one.

154
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:17,719
Before their first flight in episode
one...

155
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:22,426
...how many times did
Neviril and Amuria kiss?

156
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:26,563
Yeah, that is super difficult.

157
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,331
Before their first flight in episode
one...

158
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:33,208
...how many times did
Neviril and Amuria kiss?

159
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,544
Before their flight?

160
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:48,391
Five, four, three, two, one...

161
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:50,519
Chu-chu, chu-chu-chu!

162
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:54,929
What kind of a sound effect was that?

163
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:59,861
I thought I'd make it more quizlike.
Each team, show your answers.

164
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:02,873
First up, the Lilies. Ready, set, go!

165
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:04,477
Three times.

166
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:07,469
Three times.
Which teams answered "three times"?

167
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,443
Hey, can we get extra points for this?

168
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,851
That side interests me more.

169
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:17,885
It's Paraietta!

170
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:27,232
Listen, this isn't
a manga-drawing class, okay?

171
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:30,031
Okay, Monotones, let's see.

172
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:31,336
Ta-da.

173
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:34,238
1.5 times!

174
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:34,807
Where does the 0.5 come from?

175
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:37,503
Where does the 0.5 come from?
Wrong, wrong, wrong!

176
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:40,208
If they stopped at the last second...

177
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:42,414
We averaged it out.

178
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:49,713
Well, the correct answer is twice!

179
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:56,586
But we're closest! We're closest!

180
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:59,563
We're closer than anyone else!

181
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,960
You all said it was three times!

182
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:11,469
Since you two were so cute getting
all worked up, I'll give you points.

183
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:21,511
Enough! They told me I could
be biased and partial, all right?

184
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,189
Okay, next question.

185
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:23,553
Okay, next question.

186
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:27,558
In episode two, when Neviril
was wearing civilian clothes...

187
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,685
...what color was her bag?

188
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:33,389
A Neviril question.

189
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:35,091
Answer, answer!

190
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:36,793
Think, think.

191
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:38,164
Bag?

192
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:45,539
Wait, her hair's pink, so...

193
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:47,401
Let's go with that.

194
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:54,419
Five, four, three, two, one...

195
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:57,322
Kon-kon-kon-kon!

196
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:01,849
Did you hear that?
It was just a whisper.

197
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:05,758
Okay, let's start
with Team Lilies' answer!

198
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:07,127
Ready, set, go.

199
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:08,257
Purple.

200
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:10,130
How elegant!

201
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:12,872
Look at that smile!

202
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:15,363
Look at that smile!
She's brimming with confidence!

203
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:18,839
If she gets this one wrong,
it's going to be funny!

204
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:21,970
Neviril's answer is purple.

205
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:29,576
Okay, the Mangoes next. Ready, set...

206
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:33,318
Go! An orangish-brownish color.

207
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:36,122
An orangish-brownish color?
Which is it?

208
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:38,423
Well, it's kind of subtle.

209
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,759
More of which?

210
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,196
Mottled!

211
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,162
You mean marbled?

212
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,971
In keeping with the Simoun theme...

213
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:48,132
In keeping with the Simoun theme...
Please accept our answer!

214
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,332
Then next...

215
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:50,909
H-How cute...

216
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:54,110
To the next answer. Ready, set...

217
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,680
Go-go-go!

218
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:58,449
A pink flower pattern.

219
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:00,649
Her hair's pink, you know.

220
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:04,883
Since her hair's pink,
she decides to color coordinate.

221
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:08,357
When she has to ponder
becoming a man or woman?

222
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:11,988
"Since I've got pink hair,
let's go with a flower pattern!"

223
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:15,690
"It won't do without it."

224
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:19,298
It's very typical.

225
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,568
On to the next team,
Team Green. Ready, set...

226
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:23,767
Go. Black.

227
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:24,900
Black?

228
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:29,541
I seem to remember it was
a darkish color, like purple.

229
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:30,916
Like brown.

230
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,043
Like brown.
No, not brown!

231
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:36,250
I'll tell you the correct answer.

232
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:38,448
The correct answer is brown!

233
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,561
Hey, hold on! Hey, MC!

234
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,731
"Orangish-brownish" isn't brown!

235
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:48,598
"Orangish-brownish" isn't brown!
I think it could look orange too.

236
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,243
Okay!

237
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:59,211
Okay!
Yay!

238
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:02,676
Kaim! Kaim!

239
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:08,377
So I'm counting that
as a correct answer.

240
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,484
That's it for
the Super-Difficult Cult Quiz!

241
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:22,263
Simoun Anything and
Everything Case Files.

242
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:28,564
Okay, in this corner,
I'll ask you to answer questions...

243
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:33,111
...about inside stories,
things that happened during ADR.

244
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:35,339
So it's a kiss-and-tell contest.

245
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:38,507
I'll pick a question out of this box...

246
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:40,676
Written by you before...

247
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:45,519
So I'll start drawing, and I'd like
to discuss these stories with you all.

248
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:49,427
I'm agreeing with myself.

249
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:52,190
The keyword... Okay, here it is.

250
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:58,396
Surprised to be in a place where
women gave their all playing men!

251
00:13:58,537 --> 00:13:59,526
Right!

252
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:01,532
Meguko-chan.

253
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:08,011
Right from episode one, everyone
did a valiant job playing old men...

254
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:11,913
...throwing themselves into it,
and I was very surprised.

255
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:17,182
When they did the first session,
you could hear laughter in the booth...

256
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:20,687
The staff was cracking up.

257
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:26,254
Because usually, having a girl's voice
coming out of an old guy's mouth...

258
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:30,699
It never happened in anime till now.
It shouldn't ever happen.

259
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:35,204
<i>Government Official</i>
<i>Voiced by Megumi Toyoguchi</i>
Your daughter is
an outstanding pilot, as expected.

260
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:38,308
If we signed up for old guys,
we'd say, "This one!"

261
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,878
Like the somewhat chubby one.

262
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:46,313
I wish they'd credit us
for the old guys we played.

263
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,714
They're not old guys! Like "soldier"...

264
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:55,022
Let's move on.

265
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:57,054
Okay, um...

266
00:14:57,162 --> 00:15:00,928
Basically, I have very few lines.
And no ad libs.

267
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,898
That's me.

268
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:07,738
You see, in the beginning...

269
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:13,039
The thing is... basically,
Rimone doesn't have a lot of dialogue.

270
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:15,943
I had quite a few ad libbed lines.

271
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:21,452
But one by one, they'd say,
"Not needed, not needed, not needed."

272
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:25,717
So she hardly had dialogue.
Only a line or two when she did.

273
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:30,284
So I thought, "I wish I could
talk as much as everyone else."

274
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:33,194
That was my secret dilemma.

275
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,733
Not that it was accidental...

276
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:38,325
They pretty much delete everything.

277
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:41,565
So in the nondialogue
parts of the script...

278
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:44,438
Like when they write "turns around"...

279
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:46,374
They'd normally write "ad lib"...

280
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:51,006
But as far as this show, they're like,
"We don't need this. Cross that out."

281
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:55,610
But when you think you don't
have any lines, they add something!

282
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:58,616
Like to turn around violently.

283
00:15:58,724 --> 00:15:59,952
Like, "Hah!"

284
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:02,754
It's hard to know
where to draw the line.

285
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:06,297
And sometimes they throw
land mines like that...

286
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:10,198
Set traps for you in your path.

287
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:12,737
Okay, that's it!

288
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:25,046
Sibylla Aurea Battle
Pair Versus Pair Competition!

289
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,448
Here are the results!

290
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:36,428
All right, which team will
claim the "Golden Priestess" title?

291
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:41,864
I've taken the liberty of deciding,
and it's a biased and partial decision.

292
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:46,563
All right, well, what did
you think of the games?

293
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,469
Did you have fun? Was it hard?

294
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:51,202
I was really motivated!

295
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,676
I drew some pictures too.

296
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,576
It was pretty hard.

297
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,582
But I have a feeling we're gonna win.

298
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:00,384
Did you score?

299
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:04,013
The green in your clothes
is even more dazzling now.

300
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,517
You didn't get any points.

301
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:10,925
Anyway, let me
announce the winning team!

302
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,965
The winners are the Mangoes!

303
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:18,092
<i>Winners</i>
<i>The Mangoes</i>
Yay!

304
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,861
Yes, you put up a good fight...

305
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:22,099
As expected.

306
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,402
...and you performed well.

307
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:29,846
Now then, the Mangoes will be
presented with this Simoun candy!

308
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:36,186
Please accept it.

309
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:37,721
Kaim...

310
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:39,048
Para-sama...

311
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:42,821
Please shower your
kisses on this candy.

312
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:48,924
Calm down, Kaim!

313
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:54,029
Right, congratulations!

314
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:59,270
Okay, so the Mangoes
ended up winning today...

315
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:02,802
And I'm glad we all got
to have a good time today!

316
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,543
Please keep watching Simoun!

317
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:07,576
Please keep watching!

318
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:10,951
So the Sibylla Aurea Battle...

319
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:12,853
The Simoun... No...
