<i>Junji and Asako's</i>
<i>Know-Your-Simoun Lecture Part 3

2
00:00:01,735 --> 00:00:03,828
Fake-Anubituf and...

3
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,869
Pseudo-Guragief's...

4
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,598
Ready? One, two, three...

5
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:12,236
"I Never Thought You'd
Hide Anything from Me!"

6
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:14,713
This is a new program!

7
00:00:14,814 --> 00:00:15,548
Episode one.

8
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:16,981
Episode one.
Yes, it's episode one.

9
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,080
This is fake-Anubituf, played by...

10
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:23,384
...the director of Simoun, Nishimura.

11
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:27,423
And I'm pseudo-Guragief, played
by the character designer...

12
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:30,122
...and animation supervisor....

13
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:35,200
...slash Anubituf's lover, Anubituf's
messenger of love, Asako Nishida.

14
00:00:35,668 --> 00:00:39,331
Here's an old geezer. Right
off the bat, it's an old geezer.

15
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:41,408
You're in love with that geezertoo?

16
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:42,898
You're in love with that geezertoo?
Oh, yes, I am!

17
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,577
In my mind, this old geezer...

18
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:50,138
...lives a secluded life in a
mountain shack, dressed smartly...

19
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:54,016
...and was once an
illustrious sibylla...

20
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:57,479
...someone who'd achieved
the ultimate Ri M_a_jons.

21
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,860
The kind of person who'd
confront the military councilor...

22
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:03,794
...and snap a 100-yen coin at him
with his fingers, breaking him in two!

23
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:04,697
That's how clear a picture I had of him!

24
00:01:04,697 --> 00:01:06,221
That's how clear a picture I had of him!
Amazing.

25
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:10,228
It was like I'd accessed
Shoukoku's secret files.

26
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,438
And yet I couldn't draw his face.

27
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:14,598
His face?

28
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:19,469
And that's why I have a powerful
grudge against fake-Anubituf.

29
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:21,537
But during the
pre-production meeting...

30
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:24,139
...I remember telling you we
wouldn't be showing his face.

31
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:26,583
But his face was showing
in the storyboards...

32
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:29,486
...so I thought, "Hey, I get to show
the geezer's face just this once!"...

33
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:31,023
...and I re-edited my drawings.

34
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,855
But when the show aired, they'd
completely rubbed out his face!

35
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:36,555
I never thought you'd do
anything like that to me!

36
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:39,496
So now you're blaming me.

37
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,063
That's what it felt like to me.

38
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:44,137
Anyway, about these two...

39
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:45,468
Anyway, about these two...
Yes.

40
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:47,403
They have a casual little fling.

41
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:56,410
Well, during the course of this
scene, I completely forgot...

42
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:59,281
...that they were both girls.

43
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:01,980
That never even crossed my mind.

44
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:05,255
I started seeing them as just
having the purest feelings...

45
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:07,987
...of love for each other.
That's how I wanted to proceed.

46
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,530
Aer would be the young boy...

47
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,555
Aer would be the young boy...
Yes, that's right.

48
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:20,068
But the thing is, after this scene, Aer
starts acting more like a young girl.

49
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:23,269
It's like Neviril has to go
through the process of taming her.

50
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,804
So were you thinking it
should be like <i>My Fair Lady?</i>

51
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,642
With Neviril as Professor
Higgins thinking...

52
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:29,909
...I'm gonna transform
you into my kind of woman?

53
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,507
No, actually...

54
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:36,647
In the end, Neviril's feelings
for Aer never really changed.

55
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:41,984
On the surface, yes, it
appears that they've changed.

56
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:46,424
But not the way Neviril
felt about her deep down.

57
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:48,501
Did you choose this scene?

58
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,093
Did you choose this scene?
Yes, I chose it.

59
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:52,798
It's over.

60
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:57,098
In the character design sheet...
Oh, here's the next scene.

61
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,538
Anyway, go on, tell us.

62
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:00,340
In the character-design sheet...

63
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:03,007
...there was a description of
how her hair was being braided.

64
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:06,643
And that really intrigued me.

65
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:10,189
And I thought that in order to
create that kind of hairstyle...

66
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,953
...we'd have to show it all, the
shape and everything, on screen.

67
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:18,162
I wanted to make that
a very convincing scene.

68
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:21,057
In my eyes, that scene...

69
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:24,830
...reminded me of someone
getting ready to become a bride...

70
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:27,429
...and someone helping her prepare.

71
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:30,098
That's the feeling I
got from that scene.

72
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:35,107
Of course, Roatreamon had no
inkling that Mamina was going to die.

73
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:39,681
But Mamina was going to fly as
Neviril's pair for the first time.

74
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:42,721
So she was getting her
ready for her big moment.

75
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:46,583
Like braiding her hair
for a bridal ceremony...

76
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:49,560
That's what I was thinking
when I drew those scenes.

77
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:52,699
Hey, here it comes.

78
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:54,462
Hey, here it comes.
It's the Wauf festival!

79
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:01,996
Can you tell me why Wauf...

80
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:07,843
...is piloting such a rickety ship
and being forced to wander the borders?

81
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:13,480
Well, it goes without saying that
he's the one whom in the next series...

82
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:15,953
The next series?

83
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:18,889
According to the outline
for the next series...

84
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:22,516
He was once the leader of a yakuza
gang. That's his backstory, you see.

85
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:25,086
Are you serious? Is it okay
for you to be mentioning that?

86
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:27,496
I think they're going
to bleep it out, but...

87
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:30,365
Jun-Jun, you're so irresponsible!

88
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:32,561
Well, with that kind of story...

89
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,906
Hey, just now I started seeing a
ton of rough sketches in my mind!

90
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:41,805
We're going to see Wauf as a youngster.

91
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:43,940
Seriously? I've got those sketches too!

92
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:44,951
You already drew them?

93
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,179
You already drew them?
Oh, yes, I did!

94
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:51,417
Like "Wauf at 14" and "Wauf at 16."

95
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:52,458
So you've got everything.

96
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,221
So you've got everything.
They're all right at my fingertips.

97
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,091
I could turn in a
character-design sheet right now.

98
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:57,561
You're amazing!

99
00:04:57,897 --> 00:05:03,665
So anyway, why have they
banished Wauf to the borders?

100
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:08,503
Well, you see, he's just extremely
competent and very intelligent.

101
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:12,533
He was far too capable.
That's the reason, you see.

102
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:16,844
And since he decided he wasn't
interested in being promoted...

103
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,783
...the center ended up
deciding what they'd do...

104
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:22,047
...was send him off to the borders...

105
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:25,579
...and not allow him to participate
in their political games.

106
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,751
If I were one of the
higher-ups in the center...

107
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,261
...I'd take a guy like this
and send him to the front lines.

108
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:33,199
So he's got a lot of status?

109
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:33,927
So he's got a lot of status?
Yes.

110
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,697
I imagined him as being a
graduate of the military academy...

111
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:41,433
...and climbing higher and higher
in rank as an elite officer.

112
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:45,902
But then he grows weary of
the corruption at the top.

113
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,878
Here's his best line.

114
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:53,582
Yes, I'm sure there
was a time like that.

115
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:56,477
But wait, were we really like that once?

116
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:59,719
Is that like your own personal feeling?

117
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:03,990
Well, no, if you don't mind my
giving you a straight answer...

118
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:10,358
Just before the final episode,
the older men start talking...

119
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:12,529
...about the same thing.

120
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:18,672
In this scene, he mentions
it in a much more casual way.

121
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:22,838
But the thing is what they're
saying is actually a running theme...

122
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:25,406
...throughout this story
that holds it together.

123
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:27,419
That's my take on it.

124
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:31,184
"Long ago, we were all young girls."
So that's an underlying theme.

125
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,459
That's what we just decided!

126
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:34,193
That's what we just decided!
It's like an afterthought, but...

127
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:34,227
It's like an afterthought, but...

128
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,626
Are you serious?
It's like an afterthought, but...

129
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:40,328
That's it? I was giving it
some serious thought now...

130
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,558
Here, we kept the
scene going by using...

131
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:46,661
...nothing but the sound
of the sibyllae breathing.

132
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:48,673
We recorded everyone's
breathing, actually.

133
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:51,073
We made sure that you
couldn't tell who was whom.

134
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:52,577
You did?

135
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,904
Wait, so if we raise the
volume, can we hear it?

136
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:58,417
And the part where he's
walking down the hall...

137
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:01,309
If you look at the whole
scene, you can hear...

138
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:05,323
...each one of the sibyllae deep
in sleep and their breathing.

139
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:07,522
Well, how lewd!

140
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:09,923
Oh, yeah, it's quite scandalous.

141
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:13,431
Now this scene...

142
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:19,563
It was the very first scene I
wrote for this particular episode.

143
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:21,305
Really?

144
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,400
It was the first one that came to mind.

145
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:28,978
Here, Morinas...

146
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:31,209
I think it was in this
scene that Morinas...

147
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:34,378
...realized for the first time
that he was seeing her as a girl.

148
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,912
And that she wanted him
to see her as a girl.

149
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:41,990
But here Wap_o_rif is so
spineless! I was so mad.

150
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:49,358
If he'd been standing in front of me,
I would have punched him out!

151
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:51,096
That's how annoyed I was!

152
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,831
We got this far, and it
still wasn't enough for you?

153
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:57,239
Giving her a little kiss
and then leaving? Come on!

154
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,377
You're absolutely right.

155
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:02,708
There's no point at all.

156
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:08,253
And I really like this confession scene.

157
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:13,724
I think Morinas was gambling on this.

158
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:17,991
If he saw her as a girl,
she'd choose to become a woman.

159
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:22,527
And if he just wanted to be friends
after all, then she'd become a man...

160
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:25,002
...because she wanted to work
on the Simouns by his side.

161
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:26,272
But Wap_o_rif...

162
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:28,433
But Wap_o_rif...
They're getting smaller, aren't they?

163
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:31,510
Well, I'm certainly
glad she meant his boobs.

164
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:33,772
If she'd been pointing down there,
it would've been terrible!

165
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,679
So terrible that I'd never get
over it! You know what I mean?

166
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:41,413
Well, never mind that.
In this scene, Wap_o_rif...

167
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:45,390
Because he confessed his
love to her, he's forced to...

168
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,688
I can't keep up with you anymore.

169
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,324
Come on! Come on, Jun-Jun!

170
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:55,464
He has to eliminate one possibility.

171
00:08:55,535 --> 00:09:00,802
Losing a physical trait like that because
of love. I found that very refreshing.

172
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:07,343
Well, I'm sure you were quite shocked
as soon as you read the script.

173
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:08,710
Yes, I was!

174
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:14,980
I was rushing around since I had to
give him smaller breasts all of a sudden.

175
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:16,883
Here we go.

176
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:23,820
You said initially that
this wasn't about love...

177
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:28,224
...but I can't get that feeling out
of my head that it is about love.

178
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:33,995
Because in the commentary
for the previous volume...

179
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:38,007
...you said that Yun couldn't
experience falling in love.

180
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,910
But I think in this scene...

181
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,177
...she experiences it for
the first and only time.

182
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,818
I'm happy that you think that.

183
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:47,877
I'm happy that you think that.
Did you decide thatjust now too?

184
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:53,856
This show's story keeps
changing afterthe fact!

185
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:58,020
Yun, you see. Yun...

186
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:01,692
This is how she decided
to resolve everything.

187
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:04,699
But this decision of hers...

188
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:08,866
I just couldn't shake off
my feelings of pity for her.

189
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:13,142
Now that you've come out and
said she was probably in love...

190
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:14,770
...that makes me happy.

191
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:17,083
Looks like they're planning something.

192
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,345
Looks like they're planning something.
Here it comes. Here it comes.

193
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:21,517
Wink!

194
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:26,085
That was a little touch that
the episode director added.

195
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:28,251
It wasn't in the script.

196
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:32,423
When the storyboards came in, Kato
asked if it was all right to do that.

197
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:35,598
And I said, "Please, feel free!"

198
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,836
And this scene here...

199
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:44,500
I heard about this yesterday...

200
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:48,875
That the chors were under the direct
supervision of the military council.

201
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:51,413
But...

202
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:55,910
Anubituf had some connection
to the high priestess.

203
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:59,890
And that's what he was trying
to tell Guragief. Is that right?

204
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:03,061
He was trying to tell him about that.

205
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:07,828
Or rather, he was
just about to tell him.

206
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:09,962
He couldn't make up his mind?

207
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:11,230
Yes, in the end...

208
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:13,965
Oh, Anubituf, you baby!

209
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:19,210
Well, that's what I find
so charming about him.

210
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:24,549
In retrospect, when you give
Anubituf a second look...

211
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:28,677
...you can see that he's never
really grown up completely.

212
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:31,282
I mean, in the first place...

213
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:35,157
...remember you said that he
didn't want to get Guragief...

214
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:38,663
...involved in all the politics?

215
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:40,494
Well, tell me this. Do men...

216
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:45,333
...really try to protect
their close friends that way?

217
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,666
Yes, I'd have to say that's true.

218
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:49,408
Really?

219
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:50,397
Really?
Yes.

220
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:59,550
It's almost like a man shielding his
wife from the corrupt aspects of his job!

221
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:01,051
No, no, that's exactly it.

222
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,654
That's exactly it?

223
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:03,178
That's exactly it?
Yes, it is.

224
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:05,413
So these two...

225
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:10,495
Is that because they were in love
back when they were paired up?

226
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:16,398
Yes. Remember that idea I had
that you totally shot down?

227
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:23,466
They went to the Spring, and before they
knew it, they'd both turned into men!

228
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:27,603
They both believed that the
other would become a woman, but...

229
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:32,548
And you sent me an e-mail saying that
it wouldn't happen in a million years!

230
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:34,414
In my mind...

231
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:36,250
...I've got enough ideas for
about three different OVAs...

232
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:38,517
...focusing on these two
and their days as a pair.

233
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,616
With a whole backstory about
how they came to be lovers!

234
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:43,025
But you never even came
close to that possibility.

235
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:48,022
Oh, wait, I'm in the middle
of researching their past.

236
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,331
Really? I'll be waiting for your report.

237
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:56,769
Didn't you say there was
something about his flight suit?

238
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:58,275
Flight suit?

239
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:04,472
Oh, well, I thought the scarf
he's wearing was awesome.

240
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,778
You did? Really?

241
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:10,117
I couldn't get over how
perfect the shape was.

242
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:12,452
I mean, that was deliberate, wasn't it?

243
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:15,494
Because when you look at the
other characters' costumes...

244
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:17,688
...there's nothing similar.

245
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:19,392
Right.

246
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:23,090
But even though that's just
a scarf around his neck...

247
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:27,071
...I thought, "Wow, that
scarf is shaped so perfectly."

248
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:30,333
In other words, I got the
impression that you'd...

249
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:33,776
...deliberately drawn it so
that it wasn't quite realistic.

250
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:35,438
What do you say about that?

251
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:38,972
Yes, in anime shows featuring Hiroshi
Miyauchi, like Kaiketsu Zubat...

252
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:42,052
...or in V3, they all
wore those white scarves.

253
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:45,987
I thought that if the captain's going into
battle, then he's got to have that scarf!

254
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:50,651
And that gesture there
was another touch by Kato.

255
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:56,768
Stealing away the hearts
of young girls everywhere.

256
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:02,103
Does anyone realize what that's causing?
The e-mails I've been getting...

257
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:05,441
Oozing with love.

258
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,238
I really don't know what to do.

259
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:14,717
I think those little gestures...
There's so much attention to detail.

260
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:16,914
Yes, they really worked, didn't they?

261
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:19,389
This is the scene...

262
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:23,292
...where I put my career as an
animator on the line. I gave it my all!

263
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:27,162
And I stole it away from
Matsuda, the producer.

264
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:36,164
At first, they were just going to do it.

265
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:38,271
That's right.

266
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,978
Hey, don't say it like that!

267
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:44,882
Just a little kiss.

268
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,713
Right.

269
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:51,113
Well, I thought I was doing
a little peck. That's all.

270
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:52,752
What did you think?

271
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:54,019
I thought it worked.

272
00:14:56,128 --> 00:15:01,088
The way you showed him bracing
himself and then relaxing was perfect!

273
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,401
I couldn't believe you'd gone that far!

274
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:08,167
I carried out simulation
after simulation.

275
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:12,043
You simulated that scene?

276
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:17,139
Well, actually I walked up and
down the hall in the studio.

277
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:19,116
I played Anubituf...

278
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:24,081
...thinking, "If I stand on my tiptoes
here, I'll fall back in this manner...

279
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:27,421
...so this is where I've got to
fall away." That's what I did.

280
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,417
Amazing.

281
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:34,629
Of course you had someone
play Guragief, right?

282
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:35,993
Nope.

283
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:39,731
Virtual, virtual! Virtual Guragief!

284
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:40,940
A virtual Guragief!

285
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,271
A virtual Guragief!
That's right.

286
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:45,672
That's the measure of an animator!

287
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:47,405
Oh, I see.

288
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,342
The way Guragief braced himself
and then the way he relaxed...

289
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:53,681
I thought the timing was so
perfect it was almost funny.

290
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:55,447
Funny?

291
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:57,920
Sorry. I mean it was awesome.

292
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,751
About this girl...

293
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:06,429
Remember we were talking about
how she's connected to Amuria?

294
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:12,796
Well, it's not as though this girl
has any direct connection with Amuria.

295
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:15,999
But the story line, in
terms of structure...

296
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:19,975
The same kind of relationship
Neviril and Amuria...

297
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:23,572
...had in episode one is happening here.

298
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:27,745
That's what I hope some people will
be picking up as an underlying theme.

299
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:33,087
That's why I used the same
voice actress who played Amuria.

300
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:41,030
So you deliberately created all these
scenes where people are pairing up.

301
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,067
Yes, that's right.

302
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:43,302
At long last!

303
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:44,064
At long last!
Floef!

304
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:49,135
That's right. I was
told to talk about Floef.

305
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:52,066
Why don't you talk about him now?

306
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:56,341
Well, the thing about Floef is
that with the other characters...

307
00:16:56,415 --> 00:17:00,545
...I was able to design the way
they had matured in a natural way.

308
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:05,016
But in Floef's case, I didn't draw
him as the evolved version of Floe.

309
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:09,288
What I wanted to do was evoke my
own impression of the eternal youth.

310
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:13,161
And contrast him with Aer,
who's the eternal maiden.

311
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:16,826
That's the design I came up with.

312
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:22,597
And that's what I showed you, and I
asked you to use that design for Floef.

313
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:25,643
And you did approve the design.

314
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:26,678
That's right.

315
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:31,381
But the amazing thing is that...

316
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:37,680
...although in that respect there's no
direct link between Floe and Floef...

317
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:41,054
...as viewers, it seemed like
a perfectly natural transition.

318
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:47,528
So this is how Floe evolved!
This is how she ended up looking!

319
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:50,159
The fact that you pulled
that off is extraordinary.

320
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:55,195
You say that you evoked
something entirely different...

321
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:59,005
...but my impression is that
there's a definite emotional link.

322
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:03,137
My take on Floef is that after
everyone was done with the Simouns...

323
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:07,117
...I feel strongly that he was
the only one who came home to me.

324
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:10,553
It's like I married off
all the other girls...

325
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,485
...but Floef is the only one who...

326
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,551
...stayed by my side and
still needs me to mother him.

327
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:18,391
How about you, as the director?

328
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:23,934
I'm the dad who sent
him off, waving goodbye.

329
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:25,094
That's pretty sad!

330
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:28,333
So you're like Harukonf!
No emotional scenes!

331
