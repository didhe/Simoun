I wonder whose
"true natures" we'll expose today?

<i>Emcee: Simoun</i>
Today's guests,
please call out the title of this show.

8
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:25,558
Hello, everybody. I'm Ami
Koshimizu, and I play Paraietta.

9
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:28,891
<i>Paraietta: Ami Koshimizu</i>
Hello, everybody. I'm Ami
Koshimizu, and I play Paraietta.

10
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:32,891
<i>Kaim: Michiko Hosokoshi</i>
Hi, I'm Michiko
Hosokoshi, and I play Kaim.

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,491
Hey, that was kind of weird.

12
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:37,729
Why was it from the start?

13
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:41,034
Well, anyway,
this is part 2 of the series...

14
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:44,508
We'll be taking over this time around.

15
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:48,047
I heard part 1 with Aer and
Neviril was pretty relaxed.

16
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:49,638
The theme was "laid-back."

17
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:50,583
Then we'II...

18
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:52,642
Then we'II...
I think we should do an efficient show.

19
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:53,844
Okay?

20
00:00:53,953 --> 00:00:56,649
I don't think we're
up to it, but they know.

21
00:00:56,756 --> 00:00:57,984
Efficient.

22
00:00:58,091 --> 00:00:59,752
We'll give it a shot.

23
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:02,453
So anyway, hope you enjoy the show!

24
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:08,765
<i>Okay, we're gonna</i>
<i>start with this corner...</i>

25
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:10,737
No-Holds-Barred!?

26
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:17,540
No-Holds-Barred!?
Brutal, Live Talk Show.

27
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:25,212
<i>Have you ever fallen</i>
<i>in love with another woman?</i>

28
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:29,652
Well, I don't know if you'd
call the feeling falling in love.

29
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,782
When I see
a really gorgeous woman...

30
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:35,952
...I think, "Amazing..." or "How cool."

31
00:01:36,062 --> 00:01:38,792
I think, "I wish I could be like that."

32
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:42,026
Or I find it somehow
healing to be near her.

33
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:44,968
I've felt that,
but whether that's "love"...

34
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:49,474
True, it's also how far you
go before calling it love, right?

35
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,203
Don't you think?

36
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:52,934
It's hard!

37
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:56,311
"I really like you. Just being
with you makes me feel great."

38
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:57,951
But would I want to kiss her?

39
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,475
But would I want to kiss her?
That's another matter!

40
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:05,149
But if you could categorize love as
everything except for that kind... kind...

41
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:06,159
Oops...

42
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,093
Oops...
Speak clearly now.

43
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:10,754
I'm a voice actress by profession!

44
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:12,525
Um... right.

45
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:17,467
Then if you leave out
certain stuff like kissing...

46
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:23,509
If you can call that love, you can't
rule out falling in love with women.

47
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:28,507
<i>If you're a voice actress,</i>
<i>then speak like a professional!</i>

48
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:29,349
This one!

49
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,681
This one!
Whoa, you faked me out.

50
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:32,808
Extreme! Cool.

51
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:36,583
<i>Were you uncomfortable</i>
<i>doing extreme scenes?</i>

52
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:41,820
The most extreme one was where
we went, "Vroom... pow, pow, pow!"

53
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:44,192
That's the most extreme!

54
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:45,924
Which episode was that?

55
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:46,999
Six?

56
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:48,897
Was it six or so?

57
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:52,460
We... It was a Paraietta-
and Kaim-centric episode...

58
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:59,842
...and the two of us were totally
pretending to fly in a Simoun.

59
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:03,172
We were playing, our two characters.

60
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:08,949
And our lines were like,
"Vroom, pow-pow-pow, blam, vroom!

61
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:12,855
Like grammar school kids going,
"Vroom! This is my plane!"

62
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,519
The two of us were
playing this kids' game...

63
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:20,395
And though she's not the type to do it,
Paraietta goes "pow-pow-pow!"

64
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,094
"There's an enemy there!"
"Okay, pow-pow-pow!"

65
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:27,400
So we played that scene,
and I agree it was pretty extreme.

66
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:29,668
Like, "We're gonna get trashed!"

67
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:31,471
But really, um...

68
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:34,775
To tell the truth,
that was the most embarrassing.

69
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:42,213
<i>Sorry to interrupt as it's getting good,</i>
<i>but we're going to the next corner.</i>

70
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,891
Why Oh Why!?

71
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,882
Why Oh Why!?
Simoun.

72
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:48,388
Yay!

73
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:51,053
Well, time for a quiz, huh?

74
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:51,898
Seems so.

75
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,593
Seems so.
Okay, let's start.

76
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,065
Simoun, please.

77
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:56,829
Let's quiz.

78
00:03:57,203 --> 00:04:01,833
<i>What's a "chor"?</i>

79
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:04,306
When you go "ding, ding."

80
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,504
Yes, when you call.
We're a little off on that one.

81
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,581
It's like when you
address your butler...

82
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:13,276
"Sebastian!"

83
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,145
It's so trendy.

84
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,247
When you shoot a soccer ball...

85
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:19,450
Goal!

86
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:20,753
Hey!

87
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:26,825
Just give us
an answer already, will you?

88
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:30,434
You'd never go off track, Ami.
You weren't, Ami.

89
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:32,299
Really? Yeah, you were.

90
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:36,239
Quit it. We're supposed to be
united today. Today, it's two for one.

91
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:38,469
Well, a "chor" is...

92
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:41,604
To be specific, it refers to us...

93
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:46,811
The sibyllae as
a team is called a "chor."

94
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:52,617
<i>Correct</i>

95
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:53,192
You didn't know?

96
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:54,193
<i>What is a "chor"?</i>
<i>A unit/team</i>
You didn't know?

97
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:56,696
<i>What is a "chor"?</i>
<i>A unit/team</i>
Well, I knew there was a Chor Rubor...

98
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,598
<i>What is a "chor"?</i>
<i>A unit/team</i>
...but couldn't explain it.

99
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:01,658
<i>What is a "chor"?</i>
<i>A unit/team</i>
See? It's a unit or a team.

100
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:05,231
Like "Team Whatever."
"Team So-and-so."

101
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:08,239
I get it.
What was our team's name again?

102
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:09,676
Chor Tempest.

103
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:11,735
Chor Tempest.
Oh, yeah! Close call.

104
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:15,803
How can you remember Chor Rubor's
name and not Chor Tempest's?

105
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:20,976
<i>Time to tell everyone about</i>
<i>our CD. Advertise efficiently!</i>

106
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:26,020
This here is Toshihiko Sahashi's

107
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,593
As well as "The Majestic Symphony".

The music that's played in <i>Simoun.</i>

110

111

This CD will be released on June 21.

112
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:40,873
We hope you enjoy it!

113
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:43,706
We hope you enjoy it!
Please, please buy it!

114
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:48,707
<i>Things were pretty</i>
<i>laid-back this time around too...</i>

115
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:52,344
Okay, good work today.

116
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:53,476
How'd it go?

117
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:56,283
I have to say we were really efficient.

118
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,721
Such a brisk pace.

119
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:03,489
But I do think we did
a fun show... How about you?

120
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:08,258
I had a good time! I was like,
"Is it okay to enjoy myself this much?"

121
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,063
Was that okay?

122
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:11,966
It wasn't like a show.

123
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:16,804
It was more like the two of us having
a private conversation or something.

124
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:19,275
Still, I hope you all enjoyed it.

125
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,439
Since it's a "live talk show" after all...

126
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:26,814
About this particular DVD,
which is about to be released...

127
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:31,083
Since the feature itself is still
being broadcast to rave reviews...

128
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:35,422
...please keep watching as you wait
for the DVDs a-comin'... coming.

129
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:38,463
A-comin'? A-comin'?

130
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:42,022
Can Paraietta talk like that?
"They shall come out."

131
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:45,571
They shall come out,
and I believe they will be released.

132
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:47,434
That's it. Let's go with that.

133
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,373
So please, please support <i>Simoun.</i>
