1
00:00:00,578 --> 00:00:09,578
The countless flowers,
enveloped in light...

2
00:00:09,688 --> 00:00:20,188
...gaze at tomorrow
with unwavering eyes.

3
00:00:32,178 --> 00:00:38,848
Everyone wishes for me to be pure...

4
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:46,548
...but what can I bring
with me to the frayed skies?

5
00:00:46,658 --> 00:00:53,728
What I've made my own
by breaking off flowers in bloom...

6
00:00:54,038 --> 00:00:59,298
All such sinful things...

7
00:00:59,408 --> 00:01:06,778
Why did I stop making
promises with the future?

8
00:01:06,878 --> 00:01:14,048
Because even if I try
to run far from all the pain...

9
00:01:14,158 --> 00:01:20,788
...a cold wind rustles
my hair... Don't you see?

10
00:01:20,898 --> 00:01:28,298
Where can I ever find the answer?

11
00:01:41,848 --> 00:01:43,818
With the death of Sibylla Mamina...

12
00:01:44,588 --> 00:01:47,108
...and the ancient Simouns
now in the hands of Shoukoku...

13
00:01:47,188 --> 00:01:49,048
...you could say they've
leveled the playing field.

14
00:01:49,558 --> 00:01:52,248
No, considering their
battle expertise...

15
00:01:52,328 --> 00:01:53,848
...they now pose a
considerable threat.

16
00:01:53,928 --> 00:01:55,188
Just as we thought.

17
00:01:55,258 --> 00:01:58,788
It was reckless to send in
Chor Tempest after all...

18
00:01:59,498 --> 00:02:03,598
But Chor Tempest did cause damage
to the aerial base, didn't it?

19
00:02:05,308 --> 00:02:07,278
The enemy will need
time to regroup...

20
00:02:07,338 --> 00:02:09,828
...so I hardly think they'll
be attacking anytime soon.

21
00:02:09,908 --> 00:02:12,938
That sibylla's death
bought us some time.

22
00:02:13,018 --> 00:02:14,178
Am I wrong about that?

23
00:02:17,188 --> 00:02:21,088
Remember that Tempus Spatium is
watching over everything you do.

24
00:02:23,858 --> 00:02:29,818
Lament

25
00:02:56,188 --> 00:02:57,318
Dominüra...

26
00:02:57,388 --> 00:02:58,218
...and Rimone...

27
00:02:58,288 --> 00:02:59,848
I bet they're dead too!

28
00:03:00,658 --> 00:03:01,688
Floe...

29
00:03:04,428 --> 00:03:05,398
They all...

30
00:03:05,928 --> 00:03:07,368
They all died!

31
00:03:07,768 --> 00:03:09,598
And it's going to keep happening!

32
00:03:09,668 --> 00:03:11,038
All of us here!

33
00:03:11,368 --> 00:03:13,598
We're all going to die.
I just know it!

34
00:03:20,578 --> 00:03:21,708
You're too much.

35
00:03:21,778 --> 00:03:22,678
What do you mean by that?

36
00:03:24,548 --> 00:03:27,218
War is just a name
for killing each other.

37
00:03:27,288 --> 00:03:30,588
If you can't accept that, then you
need to go to the Spring right away.

38
00:03:40,898 --> 00:03:43,868
But why... did it
have to be Mamina?

39
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:57,478
But why... did it
have to be Mamina?

40
00:04:00,488 --> 00:04:02,618
I can't even shed tears over this.

41
00:04:03,228 --> 00:04:05,018
The day Amuria died...

42
00:04:05,088 --> 00:04:09,358
I think that maybe my own
heart died along with her.

43
00:04:12,198 --> 00:04:13,758
I've caused others pain...

44
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:17,368
Rejected their advances...

45
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:23,268
Yet despite it all, here I am,
unable to shed a tear...

46
00:04:23,348 --> 00:04:25,508
Living on with a heart
that's already dead.

47
00:04:28,048 --> 00:04:28,978
Yes.

48
00:04:29,588 --> 00:04:32,078
If only I'd died instead of Mamina.

49
00:04:46,598 --> 00:04:48,368
The Emerald...

50
00:04:56,678 --> 00:04:58,198
Have you been here all this time?

51
00:05:00,078 --> 00:05:01,708
Have you been crying?

52
00:05:06,988 --> 00:05:08,078
If only...

53
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:09,748
...I'd been stronger.

54
00:05:11,328 --> 00:05:13,388
Mamina wouldn't have died!

55
00:05:16,168 --> 00:05:17,128
If only I'd...

56
00:05:17,398 --> 00:05:18,368
No.

57
00:05:18,728 --> 00:05:21,328
I'm the one to blame,
because I was her pair.

58
00:05:21,398 --> 00:05:23,198
You had nothing to do with it.

59
00:05:24,538 --> 00:05:26,298
Don't say that I had
nothing to do with it!

60
00:05:43,128 --> 00:05:44,088
Aer...

61
00:05:45,488 --> 00:05:47,188
Why are you crying?

62
00:05:48,158 --> 00:05:51,028
What happened to the Aer who
wasn't afraid of anything?

63
00:05:54,768 --> 00:05:55,328
Amuria!

64
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:57,668
I said I want to become stronger.

65
00:05:57,738 --> 00:05:59,328
You understand, right, Neviril?

66
00:06:02,878 --> 00:06:04,468
We can do it.

67
00:06:07,678 --> 00:06:08,648
I've got to live.

68
00:06:12,618 --> 00:06:14,678
I... I've got to live.

69
00:06:18,828 --> 00:06:19,848
To live.

70
00:06:23,268 --> 00:06:28,758
Behind me lies the finest sibylla
in all of Simulacrum Kyuukoku...

71
00:06:28,838 --> 00:06:30,928
...Sibylla Aurea Neviril.

72
00:06:31,568 --> 00:06:33,668
I'm getting her out
of here no matter what.

73
00:06:33,978 --> 00:06:37,668
And not one of you will lay
so much as a finger on her!

74
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:39,608
You're right.

75
00:06:40,618 --> 00:06:41,838
We've got to live on.

76
00:07:13,448 --> 00:07:14,968
Do you want something to drink?

77
00:07:25,658 --> 00:07:30,718
Patch things up? That sounds like
we were actually friends before.

78
00:07:31,328 --> 00:07:34,028
Till the end, one of us
will always be above...

79
00:07:34,098 --> 00:07:35,928
...and the other below.

80
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:37,128
That's not true.

81
00:07:37,568 --> 00:07:40,968
Anyway, just what were
you thinking that day?

82
00:07:41,408 --> 00:07:43,068
That I wanted to be friends...

83
00:07:43,148 --> 00:07:44,038
Don't joke.

84
00:07:47,518 --> 00:07:50,038
It's because I really want
to be friends with you all.

85
00:07:54,118 --> 00:07:55,378
Mamina!

86
00:07:56,118 --> 00:07:58,318
So stop saying things like,
"We're friends," will you?

87
00:07:58,388 --> 00:08:00,378
It's just a matter of
how you feel about me.

88
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:01,388
Okay.

89
00:08:01,828 --> 00:08:03,158
I'll stop then.

90
00:08:18,908 --> 00:08:21,538
I have summoned
Onasia from the Spring.

91
00:08:21,948 --> 00:08:23,438
And the military council?

92
00:08:23,748 --> 00:08:26,718
As you have ordered,
they know nothing.

93
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:31,518
They only have eyes for warfare.

94
00:08:31,588 --> 00:08:33,148
It is truly deplorable.

95
00:08:35,428 --> 00:08:38,558
Hatred has tarnished the land.

96
00:08:38,628 --> 00:08:41,628
And yet they still cling to
this meaningless dispute...

97
00:08:41,698 --> 00:08:45,198
...which can only lead to mutual
annihilation in battle. Such foolishness!

98
00:08:48,008 --> 00:08:49,978
There is no time to lose.

99
00:08:50,508 --> 00:08:53,608
We must find our way out of this
cursed land as soon as possible.

100
00:08:53,678 --> 00:08:55,878
We must follow the path
of Tempus Spatium...

101
00:08:55,948 --> 00:08:57,708
...and open the door
to a new world!

102
00:08:58,088 --> 00:08:59,378
A new world?

103
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:02,478
Yes, and to that end...

104
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:03,888
Anubituf...

105
00:09:04,528 --> 00:09:07,048
There is much that I must
ask you to accomplish.

106
00:09:07,128 --> 00:09:08,118
First of all...

107
00:09:08,658 --> 00:09:10,058
The phantom chor.

108
00:09:10,568 --> 00:09:12,658
Chor Dextra must be resurrected!

109
00:09:19,538 --> 00:09:22,808
Granted, they're somewhat inferior
to the Simouns in performance.

110
00:09:22,878 --> 00:09:25,208
But other than that, there
are no major differences.

111
00:09:27,578 --> 00:09:29,108
Sibylla Morinas.

112
00:09:36,788 --> 00:09:38,488
Is Sibylla Neviril's Simoun...

113
00:09:38,558 --> 00:09:39,528
No.

114
00:09:39,728 --> 00:09:42,058
Dismantling the ancient
Simoun's your priority.

115
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:44,968
All else will have
to wait, I suppose?

116
00:09:45,028 --> 00:09:47,058
Oh, not that I'm
blaming you or anything!

117
00:09:47,668 --> 00:09:50,038
I'm sure you can't rebel
against your superiors.

118
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:51,968
Actually...

119
00:09:52,308 --> 00:09:54,208
It was what I
wanted to do as well.

120
00:09:56,308 --> 00:09:58,398
Sibylla Morinas...

121
00:10:01,218 --> 00:10:03,548
Would you please
go to the Spring?

122
00:10:11,258 --> 00:10:12,848
I can't do that right now.

123
00:10:12,928 --> 00:10:14,858
The Simouns are cursed!

124
00:10:15,728 --> 00:10:17,788
I don't care about the Simouns.

125
00:10:18,328 --> 00:10:19,528
Sibylla...

126
00:10:19,598 --> 00:10:22,328
"As long as I can fly a
Simoun, nothing else matters!"

127
00:10:22,398 --> 00:10:25,568
"Who cares about my comrades?"
At least, that's what I used to think.

128
00:10:25,638 --> 00:10:27,508
But it seems I was
wrong about that.

129
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:30,808
You've changed, Sibylla.

130
00:10:33,148 --> 00:10:34,308
So have you.

131
00:10:50,598 --> 00:10:52,788
Now that Mamina's gone...

132
00:10:53,128 --> 00:10:55,728
...do you think they're going
to reshuffle our pairs again?

133
00:10:56,138 --> 00:10:58,228
Yes, I suppose so.

134
00:10:58,638 --> 00:11:02,438
But for all of us to pair up...
we're short one person.

135
00:11:04,948 --> 00:11:06,468
What do you think, Para-sama?

136
00:11:09,678 --> 00:11:11,148
Hey, Para-sama.

137
00:11:12,488 --> 00:11:14,318
Don't ask me.

138
00:11:16,088 --> 00:11:17,078
Because...

139
00:11:17,688 --> 00:11:19,158
...I don't have any
answers for you.

140
00:11:20,728 --> 00:11:22,058
Para-sama...

141
00:11:25,228 --> 00:11:29,568
Mamina is dead. How do
I tell her I'm sorry?

142
00:11:30,568 --> 00:11:32,728
All I could think about
was my own problems...

143
00:11:32,808 --> 00:11:36,608
...and I wasn't performing as
a member of Chor Tempest should.

144
00:11:38,848 --> 00:11:39,838
It's hopeless.

145
00:11:40,678 --> 00:11:42,508
Since when? And how?

146
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:44,848
How did I come to this?

147
00:11:45,588 --> 00:11:46,678
How?

148
00:11:47,288 --> 00:11:48,378
Para-sama.

149
00:11:52,858 --> 00:11:53,828
Alty?

150
00:11:56,968 --> 00:11:58,398
It doesn't have to be for real.

151
00:11:58,468 --> 00:11:59,188
What?

152
00:12:00,268 --> 00:12:02,498
Just be Para-sama,
no matter what.

153
00:12:04,968 --> 00:12:08,668
It doesn't matter if they're wrong,
just make bold decisions!

154
00:12:08,738 --> 00:12:11,178
I know you're
suffering too, Paraietta!

155
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:12,608
But...

156
00:12:13,548 --> 00:12:16,748
By simply being our
heroic Para-sama...

157
00:12:16,818 --> 00:12:19,008
...you give us all
a little bit of hope.

158
00:12:19,318 --> 00:12:22,048
You say "us all," but
you mean Kaim, right?

159
00:12:24,028 --> 00:12:27,188
Why would you go so far for Kaim?

160
00:12:27,258 --> 00:12:29,528
I just wanted to see
my sister smile again.

161
00:12:29,898 --> 00:12:31,528
The reason why I wanted
to become a man...

162
00:12:31,598 --> 00:12:33,398
Why I wanted to become stronger...

163
00:12:33,938 --> 00:12:36,028
It was all because I wanted
to make my sister happy.

164
00:12:36,838 --> 00:12:38,598
But I finally realized something.

165
00:12:38,668 --> 00:12:40,898
That something's keeping
my sister from smiling...

166
00:12:40,978 --> 00:12:42,838
...and it's because
I'm in her way.

167
00:12:52,488 --> 00:12:56,388
And if that's the case, there's
only one thing I can do for her.

168
00:13:04,028 --> 00:13:05,898
For my sister's sake...

169
00:13:05,968 --> 00:13:07,328
...I'll separate myself from her.

170
00:13:17,378 --> 00:13:18,368
Paraietta-sama!

171
00:13:18,808 --> 00:13:19,968
Paraietta-sama!

172
00:13:20,148 --> 00:13:21,308
It's Sibylla Floe!

173
00:13:21,418 --> 00:13:22,378
Floe?

174
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:23,838
What's going on?

175
00:13:38,528 --> 00:13:39,298
Floe!

176
00:13:40,168 --> 00:13:41,998
Floe! What are you
doing with that suitcase?

177
00:13:42,298 --> 00:13:43,128
I'm going!

178
00:13:43,908 --> 00:13:44,808
What do you mean you're going?

179
00:13:44,808 --> 00:13:45,638
What do you mean you're going?
I'm going to the Spring!

180
00:13:45,638 --> 00:13:46,108
I'm going to the Spring!

181
00:13:47,408 --> 00:13:49,168
It's no use trying to stop me!

182
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:52,208
I have no intention
of going to war...

183
00:13:52,278 --> 00:13:53,748
...and I have no
intention of dying!

184
00:13:53,818 --> 00:13:56,378
Hold on! We should all
talk about this first.

185
00:14:01,218 --> 00:14:02,348
Roatreamon.

186
00:14:12,968 --> 00:14:14,058
What's that?

187
00:14:23,008 --> 00:14:23,938
What, for heaven's sake?

188
00:14:24,008 --> 00:14:26,538
Is it a patrol Simile?

189
00:14:26,778 --> 00:14:28,748
Where would it be
going at this hour?

190
00:14:34,988 --> 00:14:36,178
Mamina...

191
00:14:40,398 --> 00:14:42,688
Sibylla Mamina's
remains have been...

192
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:46,198
...sent to her land where
she was born and raised.

193
00:14:50,738 --> 00:14:53,208
But why? Why did you...

194
00:14:53,508 --> 00:14:55,808
It was the high priestess's wish.

195
00:14:55,878 --> 00:14:59,068
She felt that in order to
comfort Sibylla Mamina's soul...

196
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:02,278
...it would be best to return
her to her beloved homeland.

197
00:15:02,678 --> 00:15:07,638
But you could've done that after her
funeral service here on the Arcus Prima!

198
00:15:08,488 --> 00:15:09,718
You're absolutely right.

199
00:15:10,128 --> 00:15:13,488
As a Simoun sibylla
who died with honor...

200
00:15:13,558 --> 00:15:16,618
...it was our job to see that
she was given a proper burial.

201
00:15:16,698 --> 00:15:18,758
Died... with honor?

202
00:15:19,968 --> 00:15:20,758
Come in.

203
00:15:25,638 --> 00:15:26,438
Vura!

204
00:15:27,238 --> 00:15:30,578
Sibylla Vura. In place
of Sibylla Mamina...

205
00:15:30,648 --> 00:15:33,438
...she will be flying
a Simoun with you all.

206
00:15:33,548 --> 00:15:34,518
But wait!

207
00:15:34,878 --> 00:15:38,938
It is imperative that we rearrange
your pairs as soon as possible.

208
00:15:39,018 --> 00:15:42,248
As well as achieve even
more powerful Ri Majons.

209
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,018
Military Councilor!

210
00:15:44,658 --> 00:15:47,528
We have just lost one
of our precious comrades!

211
00:15:49,398 --> 00:15:51,698
Ri Majons require our souls to be clear.

212
00:15:51,768 --> 00:15:54,198
We must be able to pray
with the purest of minds!

213
00:15:54,268 --> 00:15:55,238
We are not ready...

214
00:15:55,298 --> 00:15:56,788
You speak as if you have
no cares in the world!

215
00:15:56,868 --> 00:15:57,998
What?

216
00:15:58,568 --> 00:16:02,508
Do you wish Sibylla Mamina
to have died in vain?

217
00:16:15,618 --> 00:16:16,748
You're...

218
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:28,158
It's just too cruel.

219
00:16:28,468 --> 00:16:30,898
How could they not let
us even say goodbye?

220
00:16:30,968 --> 00:16:33,338
The military councilor's
no different.

221
00:16:33,638 --> 00:16:37,698
All he can think about is war. He's not
really thinking about Mamina at all!

222
00:16:43,018 --> 00:16:44,608
It's because Mamina...

223
00:16:44,688 --> 00:16:47,148
Because she wasn't from
a Simoun sibylla family.

224
00:16:51,288 --> 00:16:53,388
It's just like Mamina said.

225
00:16:53,698 --> 00:16:56,358
I'm just a pampered
rich girl after all!

226
00:16:56,728 --> 00:16:58,428
And Mamina's feelings.

227
00:16:58,498 --> 00:17:00,298
I wanted to understand them.

228
00:17:00,638 --> 00:17:01,598
But...

229
00:17:01,668 --> 00:17:03,598
But it turns out I
didn't understand a thing!

230
00:17:04,838 --> 00:17:06,238
Do you want to understand?

231
00:17:07,238 --> 00:17:08,538
Yun.

232
00:17:09,478 --> 00:17:12,278
Mamina's feelings...
They're right here.

233
00:17:24,788 --> 00:17:26,278
It resides here...

234
00:17:26,858 --> 00:17:29,228
...Sibylla Mamina's soul.

235
00:17:31,368 --> 00:17:36,428
And this soul... it has
accepted that her life is over.

236
00:17:36,568 --> 00:17:37,298
What?

237
00:17:37,368 --> 00:17:41,238
In her eyes, it was
a meaningful death.

238
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:42,728
Who...

239
00:17:43,538 --> 00:17:45,838
You mustn't touch Onasia-sama.

240
00:17:47,478 --> 00:17:48,608
Bring it to me.

241
00:17:48,678 --> 00:17:49,738
Yes, madam.

242
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:56,978
"Accepted that her life is over?"

243
00:17:57,058 --> 00:17:59,288
I hate when people
say things like that!

244
00:17:59,358 --> 00:18:00,448
Floe...

245
00:18:00,728 --> 00:18:02,458
That's just to make
us feel better!

246
00:18:02,528 --> 00:18:05,618
How can anyone really know
what the dead are feeling?

247
00:18:06,568 --> 00:18:07,628
Roatreamon...

248
00:18:17,078 --> 00:18:21,208
I was always envious of
those braids of yours.

249
00:18:21,278 --> 00:18:23,408
But these are...

250
00:18:23,518 --> 00:18:27,318
You plait your hair because
your parents told you to.

251
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:31,808
But those things don't
mean a thing to a child.

252
00:18:31,888 --> 00:18:35,348
To me, they were a
rich girl's hairstyle.

253
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:37,328
That day...

254
00:18:38,998 --> 00:18:42,728
...I really wanted to
be friends with Mamina.

255
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:43,768
That's why I...

256
00:18:44,638 --> 00:18:46,898
Just what do you
think you're doing?

257
00:18:49,538 --> 00:18:51,268
That's why I...

258
00:18:52,148 --> 00:18:55,808
She really wanted to
be friends with us all.

259
00:19:02,858 --> 00:19:04,118
Mamina!

260
00:19:05,188 --> 00:19:06,418
Mamina!

261
00:19:22,278 --> 00:19:24,238
Mamina is a Simoun sibylla!

262
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:26,408
That's right!

263
00:19:28,348 --> 00:19:32,908
And we Simoun sibylla didn't
come here to go to war!

264
00:19:36,118 --> 00:19:36,888
Right!

265
00:19:37,558 --> 00:19:38,618
Right!

266
00:19:39,158 --> 00:19:40,628
Right!

267
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:41,988
Roatreamon!

268
00:19:43,298 --> 00:19:44,258
Let's go!

269
00:19:49,838 --> 00:19:52,668
For all of you to go, you
need one more person, right?

270
00:19:53,308 --> 00:19:54,168
Vura!

271
00:19:54,578 --> 00:19:56,738
All of my Rubor comrades
have gone to the Spring.

272
00:19:57,178 --> 00:19:59,738
But I decided to
stay here anyway...

273
00:20:00,348 --> 00:20:01,938
...for the same reason Mamina did!

274
00:20:02,218 --> 00:20:04,778
Because I wanted to
stay a Simoun sibylla!

275
00:20:08,788 --> 00:20:11,088
Vura... thank you!

276
00:20:25,568 --> 00:20:26,538
Sibylla!

277
00:20:27,808 --> 00:20:28,778
Please!

278
00:20:35,448 --> 00:20:36,968
What on earth?

279
00:20:37,218 --> 00:20:39,448
Who's allowing them
to take such liberties?

280
00:20:47,798 --> 00:20:49,758
How dare they,
in a time of emergency?

281
00:20:53,298 --> 00:20:55,668
We'll begin with one
that Mamina excelled at...

282
00:20:55,738 --> 00:20:57,258
...the Wave Crest Ri Majon!

283
00:20:57,808 --> 00:20:59,068
Roger!

284
00:21:08,118 --> 00:21:10,578
Next, let's do the
Dandelion Ri Majon!

285
00:21:22,598 --> 00:21:23,828
Just as we thought...

286
00:21:23,998 --> 00:21:24,968
Yes.

287
00:21:28,098 --> 00:21:29,998
Right! We're all...

288
00:21:31,108 --> 00:21:33,798
Aer...

289
00:21:50,628 --> 00:21:51,648
Sibyllae!

290
00:21:52,188 --> 00:21:54,348
Who inscribe our
prayers across the skies.

291
00:22:00,298 --> 00:22:01,498
Sibyllae.

292
00:22:05,538 --> 00:22:08,978
We pray for the future that
will go on forever and ever...

293
00:22:09,308 --> 00:22:13,338
And for the past that we've
already woven, we offer our prayers!

294
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,848
Sibyllae...

295
00:22:22,618 --> 00:22:23,818
Yes...

296
00:22:24,658 --> 00:22:26,148
That's who we are!

297
00:22:41,138 --> 00:22:47,778
It is played by my wounds...
the song of prayer.

298
00:22:47,878 --> 00:22:52,008
Let it ring out over
the grieving universe.

299
00:22:52,118 --> 00:22:59,078
Can we change tomorrow?
Don't be afraid.

300
00:22:59,188 --> 00:23:06,758
I want to let you know
how my heart's overflowing.

301
00:23:15,578 --> 00:23:19,568
I want to get closer to you.
I want to feel your pulse.

302
00:23:19,678 --> 00:23:24,738
I was too defiant,
and I took the long way around.

303
00:23:24,848 --> 00:23:28,718
The blue moon is swaying silently.

304
00:23:28,818 --> 00:23:32,758
My true heart's desire is you.

305
00:23:32,858 --> 00:23:38,628
I can't reach you.
My tears of pain trickle down.

306
00:23:38,728 --> 00:23:44,168
Soar away into the
sky, song of prayer.

307
00:23:44,268 --> 00:23:47,608
Carrying my love that came too late.

308
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:53,268
What can I do to change tomorrow?

309
00:23:53,378 --> 00:23:59,578
Just hold on to "now" the way it is...

310
00:24:04,858 --> 00:24:06,358
To Be Continued

311
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:09,528
Bestowed upon us by Tempus Spatium...

312
00:24:09,598 --> 00:24:11,618
...the other "if."

313
00:24:13,428 --> 00:24:15,328
Next time on Simoun...

314
00:24:15,398 --> 00:24:15,768
The Door to a New World

315
00:24:15,768 --> 00:24:17,668
The Door to a New World
The Door to a New World.

316
00:24:17,668 --> 00:24:19,828
The Door to a New World
