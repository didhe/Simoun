1
00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:06,229
Hello, I'm your emcee, Simoun.

2
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:09,540
Hello, I'm your emcee, Simoun.

3
00:00:09,709 --> 00:00:11,267
Excuse me, but I just said that I'm...

4
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:14,142
Excuse me, but I just
said that I'm the emcee!

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:17,874
Monthly!

6
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:19,411
ADR!

7
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:22,178
Bulletin!

8
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:25,088
<i>Simoun</i>
<i>Monthly! ADR Bulletin</i>

9
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:31,691
Hello, everybody! I'm Nana
Mizuki, and I play Morinas.

10
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:36,095
Hello, I'm Fumie Mizusawa,
and I play Wap_o_rif.

11
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,232
They said this is the fifth
installment.

12
00:00:39,305 --> 00:00:39,999
I know!

13
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:41,073
That's what I heard.

14
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:42,608
Wonder what's in store for us?

15
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:46,771
We're standing here, but we
really don't have any idea.

16
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,307
I wonder what we're going to do?

17
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:51,475
Well, they did tell us to relax.

18
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:52,949
They said don't be nervous.

19
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:56,420
Yes, let's just be laid-back about
it and deliver a relaxed program.

20
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:58,389
You mean just act the way we
usually do?

21
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:00,186
What do you mean by that?

22
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,895
Oh, you be quiet!

23
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,056
Oh, you be quiet!
Don't drag me into that...

24
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:07,195
And that's the way we usually are...

25
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:11,598
Why don't we proceed with
this "Monthly ADR Bulletin"?

26
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:12,933
Here we go.

27
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,607
By the way, do you know
what the word "Simoun" means?

28
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:19,071
What's that?

29
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:24,611
<i>Simouns are...</i>

30
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:28,888
<i>I want to know Simoun!</i>

31
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:35,516
Hello, hello...

32
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:36,721
Hello, hello...

33
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:40,994
In this corner, we'll be
talking about our partners...

34
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:43,627
Partners since we're not pairs.

35
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:45,136
But we are partners!

36
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:48,003
That's right, in
another way... Oh, my...

37
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:50,674
Go for it!

38
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:55,509
Anyway, we'll be talking about what
we
really want to know about our
partner.

39
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:58,176
In other words, we're
going to ask each other.

40
00:01:58,251 --> 00:01:59,775
And by doing that...
How should I say it?

41
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:01,354
Our love will grow deeper!

42
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:03,015
Our love will grow deeper!
Like making our bond stronger?

43
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:04,991
Would you like to try making it
deeper?

44
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:06,049
Would you like to try making it
deeper?
Want to do it?

45
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:10,257
So anyway, we gave this a
lot of thought, didn't we?

46
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:11,731
Who should go first?

47
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:12,565
Who should go first?
You're always first, right?

48
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:12,599
You're always first, right?

49
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,725
Are you serious?
You're always first, right?

50
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:15,135
Really?

51
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,261
Really?
No, really, really.

52
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:19,999
All right then, we'll
start with Morinas.

53
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,873
Okay, ta-da!

54
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:29,477
In your opinion, what are
Wap_o_rif's selling points?

55
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:32,677
And please try to make
Morinas swoon with your answer!

56
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:33,419
Make me swoon like crazy!

57
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:34,852
Make me swoon like crazy!
Selling points?

58
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:37,651
All right, then. From the
front she looks feminine...

59
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:40,522
...but from behind you see
that reverse-triangle shape!

60
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,155
I'd say that's her "moe-point"!

61
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:44,457
Oh, that's a good point!

62
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:46,362
See, she's actually pretty muscular.

63
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:48,067
Right, really sturdy...

64
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:49,659
Right, really sturdy...
Not to mention, she's olive toned.

65
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:50,530
Love it!

66
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:52,366
That's her selling point, I think.

67
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,300
Okay, can I go now?

68
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:57,401
Ta-da!

69
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:04,447
What's the best technique for
making yourself look erotically
cool?

70
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,348
Please instruct us, Mizuki-sensei!

71
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:08,618
Come on!

72
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:12,146
Remember how surprised we were
when we read the background info?

73
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:14,124
We were surprised!

74
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:18,221
Because it actually said
to sound "erotically cool."

75
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:22,325
They even used that person's name.

76
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:25,462
It was like, "It's written here! K-
san!"

77
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:27,933
You had to be like "K-san's child."

78
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,345
I was like, what kind of child is that?

79
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:33,846
I was like, what kind of child is that?
I've done a lot of animated shows...

80
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:35,746
I've done a lot of animated shows...

81
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:39,478
...and read a lot of
character-background fact sheets...

82
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:41,985
But none were as shocking as this
one!

83
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,147
The one for this girl.

84
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:48,058
Because you were a K-girl,
basically!

85
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:57,025
And whenever we were doing a
scene
that had subtle, nuanced
moments...

86
00:03:57,103 --> 00:04:01,164
...the recording
director would tell me...

87
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:04,107
..."In an erotically cool way! That's
where you've got to be erotically
cool!"

88
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:06,771
I was like, "Erotically cool?
Sensei, what do you mean by that?"

89
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:10,338
"Please tell me!" That's what
was going through my mind.

90
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,883
I was surprised too.

91
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:13,714
I was always thinking how
hard it must be for you.

92
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:15,981
Still, Morinas did turn
out to be erotically cool!

93
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:16,522
That makes me so happy!

94
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:17,420
That makes me so happy!
You were very appealing.

95
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:21,824
I dug down deep and emotionally let
all the erotically cool vibes out.

96
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:25,753
You released them from within! In
front of the microphone? Hit that
mic!

97
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:28,194
Make those vibes hit that mic!

98
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:31,732
So I really didn't want
anyone to see my face.

99
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:33,496
No looking!

100
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:36,440
Please listen with your eyes closed!
That's what it was like for me.

101
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,378
I have something I'd like to ask you
too.

102
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:41,176
I have something I'd like to ask you
too.
Next corner, please!

103
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:46,612
Why, Oh Why!? Simoun.

104
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:55,088
All right...

105
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:59,564
The question for this corner
will be asked by Simoun?

106
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:02,123
Okay, if you please!

107
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:06,437
What is "Sibylla Aurea"?

108
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,506
The thing is we can't just come
out with the answer, like boom!

109
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:12,578
We need to do it gradually.

110
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:14,512
We need to do it gradually.
It's hard to do this without warming
up.

111
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,612
It's easier if the answer comes to
us in the middle of the
conversation.

112
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:20,016
We can kind of get away
with scamming it that way.

113
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,482
We're thinking of that
word, right? That word?

114
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,087
All right, the answer is...

115
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,460
Ready?

116
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:33,431
Neviril!

117
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:36,964
Not bad, you two.

118
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,160
Congratulations!

119
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:43,669
The top-ranked Simoun sibylla.
"The Golden Priestess."

120
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:45,335
The Golden Priestess!

121
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:48,141
The one who sparkles
with a golden sheen!

122
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:49,977
The one we have to do this to!

123
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,551
On the way to the Spring,
everyone was doing this!

124
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:54,083
I see...

125
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:58,180
Sibylla Aurea? The one who
dazzles us with her golden sheen.

126
00:05:58,257 --> 00:05:59,622
Goldie!

127
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,417
That's it.

128
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:04,957
Time to present our merchandise...

129
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:07,728
Ta-da!

130
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:10,128
So erotic!

131
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,063
What are we gonna do with this?

132
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:16,973
You should probably hide it
between other CDs when you buy it.

133
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,567
<i>Simoun OST 2

134
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:21,169
Now, now, don't talk about it
like it's a really naughty item.

135
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:22,441
Because it isn't, really.

136
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:23,573
Guess what?

137
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:29,178
This CD includes Roatreamon's
Lullaby!

138
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,825
The one she sang to Rimone...

139
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,383
...and she sang it to Mamina too.

140
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:37,827
You could also hear the
melody during the show.

141
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,558
And this soundtrack
includes this lullaby.

142
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:42,396
I hope you all enjoy this CD!

143
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,864
By the way, who in the world are
you?

144
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,537
I'd like to ask that of you!

145
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:55,144
All right, good job!

146
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:57,614
And thank you all for watching!

147
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:00,086
What did you think?

148
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,110
What did you think?
What did you think?

149
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:02,279
We asked at the same time!

150
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:04,516
Our bond must have
gotten a little stronger!

151
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,956
Well, I have to say I got a
little nervous during the quiz.

152
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:08,288
So did I!

153
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:11,023
I was so worried we
wouldn't be able to answer!

154
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:14,495
If even the cast members can't
answer,
that would be so lame, wouldn't it?

155
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,432
I really think so!

156
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:18,237
I'm so glad I did my homework!

157
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:19,761
I'm so glad I did my homework!
Yes, thank goodness!

158
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:23,734
We have to be thankful
for our intuition!

159
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,379
Right, Morinas?

160
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:27,539
Right, Morinas?
Oh, please!

161
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:34,283
Anyway, I think we might have
made too much of a commotion...

162
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:37,322
...but thanks for putting up with us.

163
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:42,421
And please continue to watch
Simoun until the very end!

164
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:43,688
Thanks for your support!

165
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:45,993
For both the show and the DVDs as
well!

166
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:47,896
Please check out the DVDs!
