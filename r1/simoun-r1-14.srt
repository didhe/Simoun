1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:09,569
The countless flowers,
enveloped in light...

2
00:00:09,669 --> 00:00:19,769
...gaze at tomorrow
with unwavering eyes.

3
00:00:31,689 --> 00:00:38,649
Everyone wishes for me to be pure...

4
00:00:38,929 --> 00:00:46,059
...but what can I bring
with me to the frayed skies?

5
00:00:46,169 --> 00:00:53,239
What I've made my own
by breaking off flowers in bloom...

6
00:00:53,509 --> 00:00:58,809
All such sinful things...

7
00:00:58,919 --> 00:01:06,289
Why did I stop making
promises with the future?

8
00:01:06,389 --> 00:01:13,589
Because even if I try
to run far from all the pain...

9
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:20,299
...a cold wind rustles
my hair... Don't you see?

10
00:01:20,399 --> 00:01:27,829
Where can I ever find the answer?

11
00:01:31,949 --> 00:01:35,319
I could've sworn it was
somewhere around here...

12
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:43,149
Right, Neviril?

13
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,339
Around this area, our nation...

14
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,939
...shares a border not only with
Shoukoku but also with the highlands.

15
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:09,109
Perhaps the spot where Shoukoku's
aerial base was found the other day...

16
00:02:09,219 --> 00:02:11,749
...was within the highland border.

17
00:02:11,859 --> 00:02:16,759
How would you interpret that in the
clearest and most pessimistic terms?

18
00:02:16,859 --> 00:02:21,419
I'd have to say the highlands and
Shoukoku have formed an alliance...

19
00:02:21,969 --> 00:02:23,729
What is the center doing?

20
00:02:24,939 --> 00:02:26,329
Nothing.

21
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:28,599
For the next few days, the Messis...

22
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:32,069
...will dry-dock and undergo
maintenance for our return trip.

23
00:02:32,179 --> 00:02:34,939
I know that times are grim...

24
00:02:35,049 --> 00:02:38,309
...but I hope you sibyllae
will enjoy the time off.

25
00:02:38,419 --> 00:02:41,579
There's been far
too much tragedy lately.

26
00:02:43,689 --> 00:02:47,529
Yes... And most likely,
more lies ahead.

27
00:02:47,529 --> 00:02:53,489
Sacrosanct

28
00:03:16,689 --> 00:03:18,419
Oh, someone was here.

29
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:20,459
Sibylla Morinas...

30
00:03:20,559 --> 00:03:22,529
I'll leave right away.

31
00:03:23,089 --> 00:03:26,999
Don't worry about it. I'm going
to be a man myself after all.

32
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:35,699
Still, that really blew me away.

33
00:03:35,809 --> 00:03:39,369
Who knew the Simoun gem
gauged people's emotions?

34
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:44,639
It shows you that we understand
nothing about the Simouns even now.

35
00:03:44,749 --> 00:03:47,079
It does look that way.

36
00:03:47,179 --> 00:03:51,589
You said so yourself, remember?
That first day we met...

37
00:03:54,559 --> 00:03:57,579
Oh, sorry.
I just remembered, you see...

38
00:03:57,699 --> 00:04:00,029
S-Something
tells me this isn't good...

39
00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:04,729
Well, you said this before.
That years ago, you and Floe...

40
00:04:05,169 --> 00:04:08,159
Actually, Floe and I used to be in love.

41
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:10,099
I-In love?

42
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:14,769
To tell the truth, I didn't think
you made a very good couple...

43
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,679
Oh, are you mad?

44
00:04:17,979 --> 00:04:22,109
If I tell you something now, will you
keep it between the two of us?

45
00:04:24,789 --> 00:04:29,749
It's true I did harbor what could
be called affection for Sibylla Floe.

46
00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:31,159
However...

47
00:04:31,659 --> 00:04:35,719
Since she was
a sacred sibylla, I just couldn't...

48
00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:38,029
Take it to the next level.

49
00:04:39,469 --> 00:04:40,699
That's right.

50
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:44,529
No matter how
aggressively she pursued?

51
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,769
That's right. The thing is...

52
00:04:47,539 --> 00:04:49,239
Listen, Waporif.

53
00:04:49,349 --> 00:04:51,749
You and I were lovers.

54
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,849
If anyone asks, that's how
you'll answer. Understand?

55
00:05:02,989 --> 00:05:06,159
Don't worry. I won't tell anybody.

56
00:05:07,499 --> 00:05:11,199
But a story this funny...
I wonder if I can hold out?

57
00:05:11,299 --> 00:05:13,399
Sibylla Morinas!

58
00:05:18,339 --> 00:05:21,279
Anyway... I don't know
about the "sacred" part.

59
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,509
Can we really be that big of a deal?

60
00:05:26,649 --> 00:05:31,379
You feel that way because you have
yet to truly understand who you are.

61
00:05:33,619 --> 00:05:36,889
I wonder if that's all there is to it?

62
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:40,429
Is that thing really gonna work?

63
00:05:40,529 --> 00:05:42,329
Be patient. Be patient.

64
00:05:42,429 --> 00:05:44,329
I've seen it in a book.

65
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:46,199
Well, even so...

66
00:05:46,599 --> 00:05:47,759
Here's one!

67
00:05:48,109 --> 00:05:49,869
Mamina, that's awesome!

68
00:05:49,969 --> 00:05:53,429
Hey, Para-sama, it's amazing!
Come over here and see!

69
00:05:56,109 --> 00:05:57,339
Sure.

70
00:05:58,419 --> 00:06:01,609
I guess Kaim's back
to calling her "Para-sama."

71
00:06:09,929 --> 00:06:13,829
What a lovely sound...
The laughter of young girls.

72
00:06:13,929 --> 00:06:16,919
Captain, were we
really like that once?

73
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:21,159
Well, I have a feeling that
we must have been once...

74
00:06:21,269 --> 00:06:23,469
But wait, were we really?

75
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,989
You called for me, Sibylla Dominüra?

76
00:06:38,089 --> 00:06:40,019
First, let us pray.

77
00:06:45,299 --> 00:06:49,699
I need something done in secret,
and I can ask no one but you.

78
00:06:49,799 --> 00:06:52,329
The Simouns must
never be violated...

79
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:55,669
...as they are the holy
vessels of gods, correct?

80
00:06:55,769 --> 00:06:56,829
Yes.

81
00:06:56,939 --> 00:06:59,909
And this divine vessel has fallen.

82
00:07:00,609 --> 00:07:01,739
Why?

83
00:07:03,179 --> 00:07:06,949
You should already know
the answer to that question.

84
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:10,409
If you can't bring
yourself to say it, allow me.

85
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:15,259
Because the Simouns
are machines, nothing more.

86
00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:18,289
The Simoun gems,
which gauge our souls...

87
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:20,359
The helical motors...

88
00:07:21,099 --> 00:07:23,589
Granted, some mysteries remain.

89
00:07:23,969 --> 00:07:27,629
Nevertheless, the truth
is just as you described.

90
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:33,069
The Simouns' undeniable superiority
over other nations has now been lost.

91
00:07:33,179 --> 00:07:37,009
In the not-so-distant future,
the military dynamic between...

92
00:07:37,109 --> 00:07:41,739
...Simulacrum Kyuukoku and our
neighboring countries will be reversed.

93
00:07:43,219 --> 00:07:45,019
Dismantle a Simoun.

94
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:50,019
You're the one who said
they were nothing but machines.

95
00:07:51,799 --> 00:07:54,529
With all due respect,
Sibylla Dominüra...

96
00:07:55,169 --> 00:07:58,759
...that is something
we've all been long aware of.

97
00:07:58,869 --> 00:08:01,899
But people have looked
upon these "mere machines"...

98
00:08:02,009 --> 00:08:05,809
...as something divine and
sacrosanct, with love and respect.

99
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:08,779
And why do you think that is?

100
00:08:10,249 --> 00:08:15,009
Because all we have are the Simouns.
All we have are the Simouns.

101
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:19,919
And to desecrate a Simoun
is something I simply cannot do.

102
00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:28,429
You know it as well as I do.

103
00:08:35,369 --> 00:08:38,339
If we can unlock all
of the Simouns' secrets...

104
00:08:38,439 --> 00:08:41,569
...our country,
Kyuukoku, will be saved.

105
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,419
Something's not right.

106
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,249
After all this searching,
how come we haven't found it yet?

107
00:08:51,359 --> 00:08:52,619
Why?

108
00:08:53,719 --> 00:08:57,589
They could've moved the base
because we found them.

109
00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:01,789
Let's head back.

110
00:09:01,899 --> 00:09:04,559
Hold on. If I'm right,
we've got to check...

111
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:05,999
Turn back!

112
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:18,869
So you're not even
going to ask my opinion.

113
00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:22,879
It's just the two of us.
We can't bring it to a vote.

114
00:09:23,389 --> 00:09:27,409
You don't think we could ever
have the same opinion, Neviril?

115
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:08,359
I'd never before seen
a cockpit mangled so badly...

116
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:10,989
...until that day.

117
00:10:12,599 --> 00:10:17,769
I could imagine the sheer shock
and pressure sustained in that blast.

118
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:23,599
And then... when I had taken apart
the twisted wreck of the cockpit...

119
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:26,739
...I didn't find Sibylla Amuria inside.

120
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,979
But judging how
the cockpit had been mangled...

121
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:33,779
...it's not plausible that
she'd been thrown out.

122
00:10:40,899 --> 00:10:44,829
In that case,
where did Sibylla Amuria go?

123
00:10:47,299 --> 00:10:49,699
Have you made up your mind?

124
00:10:51,809 --> 00:10:53,669
I thought I had refused.

125
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:55,839
We're running out of time.

126
00:10:55,949 --> 00:10:58,539
Our neighboring countries are allying.

127
00:10:58,649 --> 00:11:01,409
That aerial base is one good example.

128
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,709
Without us knowing a thing...

129
00:11:03,819 --> 00:11:08,619
"Us"? Who do you
mean by "us," Sibylla Dominüra?

130
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:11,529
Just who are you?

131
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:31,649
What did Dominüra want?

132
00:11:31,749 --> 00:11:35,619
Oh, she said
Rimone's Simoun is malfunctioning.

133
00:11:38,819 --> 00:11:39,909
You're not...

134
00:11:41,289 --> 00:11:44,059
...a very good liar now, are you?

135
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:47,319
I guess you're right.

136
00:12:02,309 --> 00:12:03,399
Yun...

137
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:07,949
If Neviril...

138
00:12:08,049 --> 00:12:11,379
Rather, if anything happens,
I want to take off at once.

139
00:12:11,489 --> 00:12:14,889
When the time comes,
I want you to be my pair.

140
00:12:17,229 --> 00:12:20,689
The sum of one person's soul
is equal to everyone else's.

141
00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:27,139
Should you overestimate its value,
the decisions will be flawed.

142
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:31,469
Of course, if our comrades
find themselves in danger...

143
00:12:31,579 --> 00:12:34,539
...it's a given that
I would take off at once.

144
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:44,949
The Simouns are activated
by its two helical motors.

145
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:50,449
Well, to be precise, you could
say they're being manipulated.

146
00:12:51,129 --> 00:12:55,459
And beyond that fact,
we know nothing about the Simouns.

147
00:12:55,699 --> 00:12:58,289
Waporif, don't tell me that...

148
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,699
You said it once yourself.

149
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,399
That I should dismantle a Simoun.

150
00:13:16,289 --> 00:13:20,659
After flying a Simoun...
sensing that Simoun...

151
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:22,989
...I did learn something.

152
00:13:23,859 --> 00:13:26,489
That they are divine vehicles.

153
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:41,839
That they're sacred...

154
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:47,009
Just like the sibyllae themselves,
the Simouns are sacrosanct.

155
00:13:47,749 --> 00:13:48,979
However...

156
00:13:50,989 --> 00:13:56,359
I might be about to desecrate
that which is sacred.

157
00:14:10,469 --> 00:14:12,459
They didn't get back tonight.

158
00:14:12,579 --> 00:14:16,339
It's just a reconnaissance mission.
You don't have to worry.

159
00:14:16,749 --> 00:14:17,839
Aer...

160
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:22,779
Do you think she's still
planning to do an Emerald Ri Majon?

161
00:14:23,719 --> 00:14:27,819
They say things work out
if you're in love. If you love your pair...

162
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:30,449
...it makes your
Ri Majons turn out right.

163
00:14:31,089 --> 00:14:33,589
H-Hold on. That's what I told Aer.

164
00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:38,069
Is that right, Floe? Have you
really ever experienced true love?

165
00:14:38,699 --> 00:14:40,329
True love?

166
00:14:40,439 --> 00:14:43,699
Hey, don't insult me!
I'm always in true love...

167
00:14:43,769 --> 00:14:45,799
Would you be quiet?

168
00:15:22,949 --> 00:15:25,809
I'm sure you think
I'm out of my element here.

169
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:28,939
But I promise it's a fine cup of tea.

170
00:15:29,749 --> 00:15:32,219
What did you want to talk about?

171
00:15:32,659 --> 00:15:36,459
Sibylla Dominüra,
you must forgive me.

172
00:15:37,329 --> 00:15:40,229
I've looked into your background a bit.

173
00:15:42,469 --> 00:15:45,899
The only remaining survivor
of the fabled Chor Dextra.

174
00:15:45,999 --> 00:15:47,799
Chor Dextra...

175
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:51,939
Today, its very existence has
been erased from the records...

176
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:56,669
...formed for the sole purpose of
completing the Emerald Ri Majon.

177
00:15:56,779 --> 00:15:58,749
A phantom chor.

178
00:16:01,749 --> 00:16:04,309
The Emerald Ri Majon failed...

179
00:16:04,419 --> 00:16:07,249
...and the rest of
the sibyllae lost their lives.

180
00:16:07,589 --> 00:16:11,919
And now you're a sibylla under
the military council's direct command.

181
00:16:12,029 --> 00:16:16,659
An appointment that even those
high priestesses had no say in.

182
00:16:23,209 --> 00:16:25,169
Yes, that's right.

183
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:28,509
You invited me to tea to discuss that?

184
00:16:28,609 --> 00:16:33,639
No, to inform you that the plans
you're about to execute...

185
00:16:33,749 --> 00:16:38,019
...are being watched
silently by certain people.

186
00:16:41,419 --> 00:16:45,019
No matter what one intends,
in order to see it through...

187
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:49,329
...we must all have something
to believe in wholeheartedly.

188
00:16:50,099 --> 00:16:51,589
Believe in...

189
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:54,759
Something worth believing in...

190
00:16:55,669 --> 00:16:56,969
That would be...

191
00:16:57,069 --> 00:16:58,539
The Simouns.

192
00:17:10,219 --> 00:17:13,549
Whether their
mystique is valid or not...

193
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:16,289
...doesn't matter.

194
00:19:08,669 --> 00:19:11,999
The Simouns
are machines, nothing more...

195
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:15,469
They are not
divine vessels by any means.

196
00:20:09,469 --> 00:20:10,829
So it's done.

197
00:20:10,929 --> 00:20:12,159
Yes.

198
00:20:12,699 --> 00:20:15,229
But I found nothing inside.

199
00:20:16,709 --> 00:20:20,339
At least, not anything
we'd be able to comprehend.

200
00:20:24,379 --> 00:20:26,709
What's there is nothing but a helix.

201
00:20:27,549 --> 00:20:30,709
The only thing we're
capable of understanding is...

202
00:20:38,459 --> 00:20:40,449
Sibylla Dominüra...

203
00:20:48,769 --> 00:20:50,329
It can't be...

204
00:20:55,249 --> 00:20:56,709
You can...

205
00:20:56,809 --> 00:20:59,279
You're able to see
something, aren't you?

206
00:21:01,879 --> 00:21:03,849
You can see something!

207
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:06,379
What can you see?

208
00:21:06,489 --> 00:21:08,479
Sibylla Dominüra!

209
00:21:18,129 --> 00:21:19,829
That voice just now...

210
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:23,099
Dominüra...

211
00:21:23,209 --> 00:21:24,309
Let's go see what happened.

212
00:21:24,309 --> 00:21:26,939
Let's go see what happened.
She's on the flight deck!

213
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:30,069
Take Sibylla Dominüra to my room.

214
00:21:30,149 --> 00:21:30,979
Yes, sir.

215
00:21:31,049 --> 00:21:32,909
What happened? Is Dominüra...

216
00:21:33,019 --> 00:21:35,849
She's all right!
Sibyllae, if you please...

217
00:21:35,949 --> 00:21:39,249
Sibyllae, if you would
please step aside...

218
00:22:21,029 --> 00:22:22,999
Huh? I just heard...

219
00:22:23,369 --> 00:22:26,159
...somebody crying.

220
00:22:40,479 --> 00:22:47,079
It is played by my wounds...
the song of prayer.

221
00:22:47,189 --> 00:22:51,349
Let it ring out over
the grieving universe.

222
00:22:51,459 --> 00:22:58,389
Can we change tomorrow?
Don't be afraid.

223
00:22:58,499 --> 00:23:06,069
I want to let you know
how my heart's overflowing.

224
00:23:14,879 --> 00:23:18,909
"I want to get closer to you."
"I want to feel your pulse."

225
00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:24,079
I was too defiant,
and I took the long way around.

226
00:23:24,189 --> 00:23:28,059
The blue moon is swaying silently.

227
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,829
My true heart's desire is you.

228
00:23:32,139 --> 00:23:37,509
I can't reach you.
My tears of pain trickle down.

229
00:23:38,069 --> 00:23:43,509
Soar away into the sky, song of prayer.

230
00:23:43,609 --> 00:23:46,909
Carrying my love that came too late.

231
00:23:47,019 --> 00:23:52,609
What can I do to change tomorrow?

232
00:23:52,719 --> 00:23:59,029
Just hold on to "now" the way it is...

233
00:24:03,699 --> 00:24:04,829
To Be Continued

234
00:24:05,499 --> 00:24:07,199
Shoukoku's upgraded aircraft...

235
00:24:07,299 --> 00:24:11,669
...are relentlessly threatening us,
and our forces are being scattered.

236
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:14,709
Next time on Simoun...

237
00:24:14,809 --> 00:24:15,079
One, and Then Another

238
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:17,379
One, and Then Another
One, and Then Another.

239
00:24:17,379 --> 00:24:19,279
One, and Then Another
