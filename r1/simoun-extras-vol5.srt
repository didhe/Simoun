All right, I'm Mamiko Noto,

All right, I'm Mamiko Noto,

All right, I'm Mamiko Noto,
and I play Rimone.

14
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:31,097
Hello, I'm Yukana,

16
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:36,159
Right?

17
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:37,236
Monthly...

18
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:39,931
That's the third time you said that!

19
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,600
You're right. What should I do?

20
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:47,139
Anyway, the two of us are
in charge of this installment...

21
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,047
It'll be very calm and gentle,
a laid-back show...

22
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:53,483
Calm? I like that.

23
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,748
Laid-back? Calm and gentle.

24
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:57,957
It is.

25
00:00:57,957 --> 00:00:58,719
It is.
Right.

26
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:01,589
So we're just going to be ourselves...

27
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:04,686
We'll present
the show in this fashion.

28
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:07,358
We hope you enjoy it!

29
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:13,039
<i>Now then, let's start with this corner.</i>

30
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:16,668
Hey, why are you
presenting the show, huh?

31
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,411
No-holds-barred!?

32
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:19,435
No-holds-barred!?
A Brutal...

33
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:19,813
Live Talk Show!

34
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:22,115

36
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:27,319
Right.

37
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:31,615
Now that's really laid-back...

38
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:33,385
Super laid-back...

39
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:35,624
Extremely laid-back.

40
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:39,664
But they must've known
when they chose us...

41
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:42,860
You think so? I guess you're right.

42
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:46,564
Of the whole Simoun cast,
we're the most laid-back!

43
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:49,471
You think so too, Yukana-san?

44
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:54,581
Please tell us what you've
fallen in love with recently.

45
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:54,981
<i>Please tell us what you've</i>
<i>fallen in love with recently.</i>
Please tell us what you've

46
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:57,317
<i>Please tell us what you've</i>
<i>fallen in love with recently.</i>
What we've fallen
in love with recently?

47
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:59,085
<i>Please tell us what you've</i>
<i>fallen in love with recently.</i>
Vegetable juice!

48
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:01,053
<i>Please tell us what you've</i>
<i>fallen in love with recently.</i>

49
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:03,383
Vegetable juice is your love?

50
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:04,357
I'm obsessed.

51
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:05,756
I'm obsessed.
The sweet kind?

52
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:07,724
It's kale-based.

53
00:02:07,827 --> 00:02:11,194
It's easier for me to drink if it's
kale-based. It's not very sweet.

54
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:15,358
So it's not very bitter,
and it tastes very green.

55
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:16,560
Right.

56
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,600
I'm so in love with it.

57
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:22,400
As for me, I was
drinking some just now... Cassis.

58
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:25,342
Oh, you mean in that little can?

59
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:31,280
People who aren't
used to it say it tastes sour...

60
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:35,950
But it's that sweet
and tangy taste that I like...

61
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:40,985
You don't really see it in stores...
I mean I've never seen it in stores.

62
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:45,292
Oh, right. Not that
many places carry it.

63
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:49,932
<i>Hold on, aren't you two</i>
<i>digressing from the subject?</i>

64
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:51,427
Next one?

65
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:53,802
All right, then this one!

66
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:55,235
Um...

67
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:59,709
If there was a Ri M_a_jon you'd like
to invent, what would you name it?

68
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:00,446
<i>If there was a Ri M_a_jon you'd like</i>
<i>to invent, what would you name it?</i>

69
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:03,016
<i>If there was a Ri M_a_jon you'd like</i>
<i>to invent, what would you name it?</i>
A name for a Ri M_a_jon?

70
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,745
<i>If there was a Ri M_a_jon you'd like</i>
<i>to invent, what would you name it?</i>

71
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,645
How about after a flower?

72
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:08,277
Oh, how lovely...

73
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:09,455
Sounds kinda good.

74
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:10,444
Sounds kinda good.
Pretty.

75
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:15,358
If you flourish it like this... When you
do that, everyone starts smiling.

76
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:16,689
Was that weird?

77
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:19,822
l-It's okay. It's okay. I like it.

78
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,161
Are you sure?

79
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:22,256
I'm sure.

80
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:23,892
It would be nice.

81
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:27,666
That's keeping with the image
of Ri M_a_jons, don't you think?

82
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:29,537
Flowers and such...

83
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:38,113
<i>Hey, you!</i>
<i>Move this show along, will you?</i>

84
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:40,320
Why Oh Why? Simoun!

85
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,754
<i>Why Oh Why!? Simoun</i>
Why Oh Why? Simoun!

86
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:43,585
<i>Why Oh Why!? Simoun</i>

87
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:49,688
Okay, now it's time for a quiz.

88
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:54,460
Simoun-sama,
please read out the questions.

89
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:56,636
<i>Just what is "Tempus Spatium"?</i>

90
00:03:56,636 --> 00:04:00,299
<i>Just what is "Tempus Spatium"?</i>
<i>Just what is "Tempus Spatium"?</i>

91
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,939
<i>Don't talk at the same time...</i>

92
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:05,873
The wings...

93
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:07,571
The... uh...

94
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,977
Their religion.

95
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,515
That's right.

96
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,074
The deity they worship or whatever.

97
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:15,177
But how should we explain it?

98
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:17,222
Um, probably...

99
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:21,351
Our nation,
Simulacrum Kyuukoku's...

100
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:22,929
Uh, what?

101
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,123
Uh, what?
Domin_u_ra...

102
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:28,963
Um, h-how should I put it?
Our one and only... absolute god.

103
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:32,964
<i>Well, of course</i>
<i>she'd get that one right.</i>

104
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,240
Correct!

105
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:41,444
<i>What is Tempus Spatium?</i>
The god worshipped by
the people of Simulacrum Kyuukoku.

106
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:45,506
Tempus Spatium's court protects
the "Spring," its religious center...

107
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:50,021
...which is served across
the nation by the great temple.

108
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:53,182
Oh, then that means that the Spring...

109
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:58,321
...Onasia's spring, the one Elly
entered, is the center of their religion.

110
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,023
In the middle.

111
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,028
<i>Now then, time for...</i>

112
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:05,004
<i>Product Presentation.</i>

113
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:07,029
<i>Product Presentation.</i>
Hey, why'd the camera move?

114
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:12,843
All right, here's what you've been
waiting for, Simoun DVD volume one!

115
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:15,807
August 25th, everybody!

116
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:19,146
That's the date
it's going to be released.

117
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:25,816
And here are the bonus features for
the limited edition. These two here.

118
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:31,522
Postcards by the character designer,
Nishida-san, will be included.

119
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:36,466
And this time around,
the pairing is of Neviril and Aer.

120
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:42,201
Simoun DVD volume 1
will be released on August 25th.

121
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:45,004
We hope you'll support Simoun...

122
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,642
<i>Some closing words please.</i>

123
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:54,976
<i>You could've just spoken</i>
<i>in Japanese from the start...</i>

124
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:58,185
All right... That's about it...

125
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,351
Right, we've come to the end...

126
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:05,627
That went by really fast, didn't it?

127
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,527
How was it, Mamiko Noto-san?

128
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:13,799
Well, it felt as though time
was passing very, very slowly...

129
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:19,804
But it was great getting the chance
to talk to you like this one-on-one...

130
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:22,938
...because although
we do chat during breaks...

131
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:28,316
It was the first time we did
a presentation and discussed Simoun.

132
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:32,414
Right, it was a valuable opportunity!

133
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:37,428
Well, I... Normally, when
I'm talking with Mamiko-chan...

134
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:41,296
I don't really say a lot, unlike today...

135
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:45,201
I have a feeling some people
will be like, "You talk even <i>less?"</i>

136
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:46,601
Words aren't...

137
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:50,301
Yes, it's not
a matter of words, you see.

138
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:54,002
Usually, I'll just look at her face...

139
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:57,139
...and maybe say
something once in a while.

140
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:02,119
So for the two of us,
I think we talked a <i>lot</i> today.

141
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:05,451
I really hope you all enjoyed our chat.

142
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:09,858
And that ends our
Monthly ADR Bulletin.

143
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:11,798
Bye-bye...

144
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:12,365
<i>Don't miss the next episode!</i>
