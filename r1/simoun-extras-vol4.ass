Dialogue: 0,0:01:57.65,0:02:02.55,Regular,,0,0,0,,So it seems the story got even more\Nconfusing since little was explained.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:02.66,0:02:08.39,Regular,,0,0,0,,But I thought that should be an aspect\Nof the overall {\i1}Simoun{\i0} worldview.

Dialogue: 0,0:03:04.72,0:03:10.21,Regular,,0,0,0,,This scene is what you'd call the\Nheart and essence of the entire series.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:10.32,0:03:11.72,Regular,,0,0,0,,As a matter of fact.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:11.82,0:03:18.09,Regular,,0,0,0,,Did you notice how forced it was\Ngoing to that overwhelming red sky?

Dialogue: 0,0:03:30.18,0:03:32.80,Regular,,0,0,0,,...and he asked,\N"Are you really okay with this?"
Dialogue: 0,0:03:32.91,0:03:38.71,Regular,,0,0,0,,He spoke of how the worldview\Nwas real yet dramatically contrived.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:40.12,0:03:42.18,Regular,,0,0,0,,How should I put it?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:42.29,0:03:46.28,Regular,,0,0,0,,A world depicted in images.\NBattle scenes, for instance.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:46.39,0:03:50.89,Regular,,0,0,0,,And a significant number of\Nthem were depicted in that style.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:51.00,0:03:56.49,Regular,,0,0,0,,Personally, I think it worked out when\NI saw the episode one storyboards...
Dialogue: 0,0:03:56.60,0:03:59.77,Regular,,0,0,0,,...and I neverthought I'd\Nsee the use of "harmonies"...
Dialogue: 0,0:03:59.87,0:04:03.10,Regular,,0,0,0,,We call the pastel\Nfreeze-frame shots "harmonies."
Dialogue: 0,0:04:03.21,0:04:06.37,Regular,,0,0,0,,I never thought\NI'd see harmonies used.

Dialogue: 0,0:04:07.75,0:04:10.15,Regular,,0,0,0,,When I first watched the episode...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:10.25,0:04:14.81,Regular,,0,0,0,,...my personal opinion was that\Nthe harmonies didn't really fit in.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:16.26,0:04:20.19,Regular,,0,0,0,,But I can see quite a lot of\Nmotivation behind those shots...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:20.29,0:04:23.89,Regular,,0,0,0,,In episode one, those harmonies\Nappeared at least twice.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:24.00,0:04:24.76,Regular,,0,0,0,,Yes.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:24.86,0:04:26.33,Regular,,0,0,0,,Why'd you do them?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:26.43,0:04:31.27,Regular,,0,0,0,,It was an artistic decision...\Nthat also got mixed reviews.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:31.70,0:04:34.17,Regular,,0,0,0,,Why did you do\Nthose mural paintings?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:34.27,0:04:37.94,Regular,,0,0,0,,I was flooded with so\Nmany comments about that.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:38.04,0:04:42.14,Regular,,0,0,0,,But you see... I couldn't\Nadvance the story without them.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:42.25,0:04:47.31,Regular,,0,0,0,,There was no other way to link\Nthe scenes. That's all I can say.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.12,0:04:53.12,Regular,,0,0,0,,So it was a directorial decision?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:53.23,0:04:55.66,Regular,,0,0,0,,I'd have to say yes.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:55.76,0:05:00.82,Regular,,0,0,0,,There were people who asked me\Nif I was an Osamu Dezaki disciple.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:00.93,0:05:04.56,Regular,,0,0,0,,Sure, I respect him,\Nbut I'm not a disciple.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:04.67,0:05:11.54,Regular,,0,0,0,,Well, let me ask you this.\NThe art director is Kobayashi-san...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:11.64,0:05:17.51,Regular,,0,0,0,,So I was wondering if he was the one\Nwith a real affinity for harmonies.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:17.62,0:05:22.28,Regular,,0,0,0,,Well, of course he would\Nnever say he wanted to do them.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:22.39,0:05:23.45,Regular,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:23.56,0:05:29.55,Regular,,0,0,0,,But if I want to do harmonies,\Nand he does the artwork...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:29.66,0:05:33.89,Regular,,0,0,0,,...there's no way we'd end up\Nwithout harmonies, you see.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:34.00,0:05:36.43,Regular,,0,0,0,,That was yourthought as director?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.54,0:05:39.00,Regular,,0,0,0,,Because after all, he...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.44,0:05:46.97,Regular,,0,0,0,,He's a purist who holds on to\Nthe old-school way of doing artwork.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.95,0:05:54.78,Regular,,0,0,0,,Today, there's so much you\Ncan do with digital processing...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.89,0:05:59.29,Regular,,0,0,0,,...but he's the type who does all\Nhe can to work in the old style.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:59.39,0:06:07.49,Regular,,0,0,0,,And anotherthing... Today, you\Nnever see cel animation anymore...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:08.07,0:06:10.59,Regular,,0,0,0,,...but he still has them somehow.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:10.70,0:06:12.47,Regular,,0,0,0,,He does?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:12.57,0:06:15.94,Regular,,0,0,0,,And he turns in cels that he's drawn.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:16.11,0:06:19.04,Regular,,0,0,0,,You wouldn't believe it...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:17.11,0:06:19.04,Regular,,0,0,0,,Here we go.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:19.14,0:06:20.74,Regular,,0,0,0,,She'll chop them off!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:20.85,0:06:23.34,Regular,,0,0,0,,She'll create a huge scene.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:26.72,0:06:30.35,Regular,,0,0,0,,We show the corpse in\Na series of harmonies here too.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:30.46,0:06:31.79,Regular,,0,0,0,,That's right.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:36.13,0:06:39.86,Regular,,0,0,0,,You know, I really,\Nreally love this scene.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:42.87,0:06:45.96,Regular,,0,0,0,,Was that one\Nof your creative decisions?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:46.07,0:06:48.80,Regular,,0,0,0,,To have her chop up the body?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:48.91,0:06:52.94,Regular,,0,0,0,,No, actually... I didn't write this scene.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:53.04,0:06:58.07,Regular,,0,0,0,,When the first script was turned in,\Nit was actually even more graphic.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.22,0:07:01.78,Regular,,0,0,0,,Do you think it's\Nall right to describe it now?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:01.89,0:07:03.52,Regular,,0,0,0,,Sure, why not.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:03.62,0:07:05.06,Regular,,0,0,0,,Long story short...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:05.16,0:07:10.19,Regular,,0,0,0,,...she chops off his fingers to remove\Nthem from the steering wheel, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:10.30,0:07:12.79,Regular,,0,0,0,,Either his fingers or his wrists.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:12.90,0:07:16.60,Regular,,0,0,0,,But in the earlier version,\Nshe actually mutilated...

Dialogue: 0,0:07:20.07,0:07:25.60,Regular,,0,0,0,,That's right. She dismembers him\Nand disposes of him piece by piece.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:25.71,0:07:28.41,Regular,,0,0,0,,The first draft was brutal.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:28.51,0:07:32.01,Regular,,0,0,0,,And I wanted to keep that\Nquality as much as possible...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:32.12,0:07:36.45,Regular,,0,0,0,,...but when I started considering\Nthe {\i1}Simoun{\i0} worldview...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:36.56,0:07:41.52,Regular,,0,0,0,,...I wasn't sure I could go that\Nfar in terms of repulsive behavior.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:41.63,0:07:45.26,Regular,,0,0,0,,It was really\Na challenge in that respect.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:47.13,0:07:52.44,Regular,,0,0,0,,But it was this scene that\Nmade me see Aer as a young girl.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:52.67,0:07:54.61,Regular,,0,0,0,,Oh, I see.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:56.84,0:08:02.64,Regular,,0,0,0,,I read in the DVD's liner notes that\Nmost dismemberment homicides...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:03.52,0:08:06.85,Regular,,0,0,0,,...are committed by females\Nto an overwhelming degree.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:06.92,0:08:08.25,Regular,,0,0,0,,Is that so?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:08.35,0:08:11.32,Regular,,0,0,0,,Because women aren't\Nstrong enough to carry corpses.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:11.42,0:08:13.55,Regular,,0,0,0,,So we were on point.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:14.96,0:08:17.86,Regular,,0,0,0,,Uh, we were just\Ntalking about corpses...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:17.96,0:08:21.59,Regular,,0,0,0,,...and suddenly we're seeing\Nsomeone get their nails done.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:24.24,0:08:29.57,Regular,,0,0,0,,This is another scene that\Ndidn't follow the original script.

Dialogue: 0,0:08:32.58,0:08:34.51,Regular,,0,0,0,,What was it then?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:35.82,0:08:39.94,Regular,,0,0,0,,Well, it was much simpler.\NShe was pouring tea for her.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:40.05,0:08:43.54,Regular,,0,0,0,,I think that was how the scene went.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:44.59,0:08:47.56,Regular,,0,0,0,,Then the episode director said, "No...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:47.73,0:08:50.72,Regular,,0,0,0,,...it won't work unless\Nthere's some touching involved."

Dialogue: 0,0:09:37.04,0:09:39.94,Regular,,0,0,0,,Well, a bedroom\Nwould've been fine too...
Dialogue: 0,0:09:40.05,0:09:44.98,Regular,,0,0,0,,...but personally, I think it's more\Nappealing under that blue ceiling.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:45.08,0:09:47.95,Regular,,0,0,0,,Oh? I'm very sorry about that.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:48.05,0:09:49.38,Regular,,0,0,0,,Did you flinch?

Dialogue: 0,0:09:55.06,0:10:00.97,Regular,,0,0,0,,But anyway, this scene really fits in\Nwith the {\i1}Simoun{\i0} worldview, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:01.43,0:10:04.37,Regular,,0,0,0,,Yes. It's pretty symbolic, isn't it?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:06.54,0:10:10.77,Regular,,0,0,0,,What happens next when Kaim...
