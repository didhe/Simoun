1
00:00:00,989 --> 00:00:09,989
The countless flowers,
enveloped in light...

2
00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:20,599
...gaze at tomorrow
with unwavering eyes.

3
00:00:32,589 --> 00:00:39,249
Everyone wishes for me to be pure...

4
00:00:39,859 --> 00:00:46,959
...but what can I bring
with me to the frayed skies?

5
00:00:47,069 --> 00:00:54,129
What I've made my own
by breaking off flowers in bloom...

6
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:59,709
All such sinful things...

7
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:07,189
Why did I stop making
promises with the future?

8
00:01:07,289 --> 00:01:14,459
Because even if I try
to run far from all the pain...

9
00:01:14,559 --> 00:01:21,199
...a cold wind rustles
my hair... Don't you see?

10
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:28,709
Where can I ever find the answer?

11
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:38,709
I have lived all this time
without ever making a decision.

12
00:01:39,289 --> 00:01:42,449
This is my punishment.

13
00:01:43,289 --> 00:01:46,779
I failed to become an eternal maiden.

14
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:50,759
And I failed to make my way to
that other world. I remained here.

15
00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:53,799
Never to touch another.

16
00:01:54,139 --> 00:01:58,659
Never to feel another's
embrace. And still...

17
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:00,559
I remain here.

18
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:01,869
But why?

19
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:04,239
Why did they do that to your body?

20
00:02:04,679 --> 00:02:07,839
Because I refused to
choose a permanent gender...

21
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:11,779
...they sentenced me to become
the gatekeeper of the Spring.

22
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:13,649
Because you wouldn't choose?

23
00:02:14,059 --> 00:02:18,049
So that no future maiden
would make the same mistake.

24
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:20,489
To stand here for all time...

25
00:02:20,589 --> 00:02:24,929
That is my penance for
running away from reality.

26
00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:45,679
Choices

27
00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:51,189
Chor Tempest is to be
officially disbanded.

28
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:54,019
Sibyllae, we have decided that it is
now time for you to go to the Spring.

29
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:54,689
What?

30
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:56,659
Just a moment!

31
00:02:56,729 --> 00:02:59,219
Why are we also being stripped
of our posts as sibyllae?

32
00:02:59,299 --> 00:03:03,399
You will be ceding your duties
to the Plumbum priestesses.

33
00:03:03,469 --> 00:03:04,769
No way!

34
00:03:05,009 --> 00:03:06,299
Father!

35
00:03:07,909 --> 00:03:11,939
They won't even let us be Simoun
sibyllae anymore? Then that means...

36
00:03:12,009 --> 00:03:14,879
We'll have to leave the Arcus Prima!

37
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:17,179
Is that what you're saying?

38
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,189
Well, forcing them to make a
decision like that so suddenly...

39
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:23,379
We can hardly expect them to
choose on such short notice!

40
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:25,029
They need time to prepare.

41
00:03:25,029 --> 00:03:26,389
They need time to prepare.
We are out of time.

42
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:28,449
All we're asking for is a short period.

43
00:03:28,529 --> 00:03:32,519
Compared to the long history
of Simulacrum Kyuukoku...

44
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:34,329
...it would only be a fleeting moment.

45
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:43,009
Sibylla Morinas...

46
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:45,439
You heard what's happening to us, right?

47
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:47,279
Yes.

48
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:49,349
Are you happy now?

49
00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:52,579
Actually...

50
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:56,079
I'm going to be leaving
the Arcus Prima as well.

51
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:01,219
Kyuukoku won't be flying
the Simouns any longer.

52
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:05,029
And to prove it, the entire maintenance
crew is being moved to the highlands.

53
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:06,529
What?

54
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:08,929
It's all the same to us
no matter where we end up.

55
00:04:09,469 --> 00:04:13,409
The Simouns are the
divine vessels of the gods.

56
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:14,769
And yet...

57
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:17,669
No matter how close I try to get...

58
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:21,279
No, the truth is that I've
discovered something about myself.

59
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:23,949
I no longer care about the Simouns!

60
00:04:24,549 --> 00:04:28,649
As long as I know you're safe,
that's enough to make me happy.

61
00:04:33,329 --> 00:04:35,589
Go ahead and despise me now.

62
00:04:38,869 --> 00:04:41,729
They're getting smaller, aren't they?

63
00:04:46,409 --> 00:04:51,279
I wanted to become a man and putter
around with you and the Simouns, but...

64
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:15,129
Which are you going to choose?

65
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:19,539
I guess you've always
wanted to become a man, huh?

66
00:05:19,609 --> 00:05:23,699
You probably couldn't care less that
we're being forced to go to the Spring.

67
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:27,239
That's right. You've always...

68
00:05:27,309 --> 00:05:28,609
That's so not true!

69
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:31,479
I'm scared too!

70
00:05:31,549 --> 00:05:33,679
It scares me that we
have to grow up now!

71
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:36,309
I want to lean on someone else...

72
00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:39,479
I want someone to protect me! But...

73
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:40,729
Alty...

74
00:05:40,999 --> 00:05:42,959
Oh, shut up, you dummy!

75
00:05:43,559 --> 00:05:45,189
What a dummy you are, Big Sister!

76
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,999
Dummy!

77
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:52,459
Dummy... dummy... dummy... dummy!

78
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:59,999
Picking a fight with your sister?
I mean, how immature is that?

79
00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:06,919
You're still just kids. You're
both too young to become adults.

80
00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:12,619
Hey, Vura, all the Chor Rubor girls
already picked their genders, right?

81
00:06:12,989 --> 00:06:15,889
The ones who had a family
business to take over became male.

82
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,729
The others, well, it was pretty random.

83
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:18,889
Oh?

84
00:06:18,969 --> 00:06:20,019
What about you, Floe?

85
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:24,539
Me? Whatever. I don't really
care which I end up being!

86
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,509
Of course, if I were in love, I would
be telling a different story, but...

87
00:06:27,579 --> 00:06:31,509
Really? But everyone says that
you've got a thing for Aer.

88
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:33,979
Right, and I've told them over
and over that it's not true!

89
00:06:34,049 --> 00:06:37,069
Oh, for heaven's sake.
What does it matter, anyway?

90
00:06:37,549 --> 00:06:39,379
But I don't know...

91
00:06:40,089 --> 00:06:42,149
For some reason I feel so lonely.

92
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,729
That's what growing up is all about.

93
00:06:50,229 --> 00:06:54,169
So if you feel lonely,
it means you've grown up?

94
00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:00,439
I just remembered something.

95
00:07:01,109 --> 00:07:03,439
Alty was such a moron!

96
00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:09,039
Darn it, didn't I tell
you not to tag along?

97
00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:11,279
You're always slowing me down, Alty!

98
00:07:12,049 --> 00:07:13,749
And you're such a dummy, Big Sister!

99
00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:16,949
Who are you calling a dummy?
You clumsy slowpoke!

100
00:07:17,119 --> 00:07:18,489
Dummy!

101
00:07:18,589 --> 00:07:21,459
Whatever! You can find your
own way back then, you wimp!

102
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:25,059
Dummy!

103
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:29,929
Dummy!

104
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,639
You're such a dummy, Big Sister!

105
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:39,679
Even if we were in the
middle of a fight...

106
00:07:39,749 --> 00:07:43,509
...she could never come up
with any names to call me.

107
00:07:45,249 --> 00:07:47,349
She could never say
anything except, "Dummy!"

108
00:07:48,989 --> 00:07:52,359
And the thing is she never learned.
She just kept following me.

109
00:07:52,859 --> 00:07:56,189
I mean, really... What a
little moron of a sister I have!

110
00:07:56,899 --> 00:08:00,389
I wonder when it was
that Alty stopped being...

111
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,139
...such a little wimp.

112
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,329
I'm going to protect you, Big Sister.

113
00:08:06,409 --> 00:08:10,639
She got such an assertive look
in her eyes, and she grew so tall.

114
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:15,279
It was like she suddenly became
more of a grownup than me.

115
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,779
But because so much was
going on, I didn't even notice.

116
00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:23,979
To me, Alty was still
the same little wimp.

117
00:08:24,189 --> 00:08:27,919
And I've always averted my gaze from
her. I just didn't want to believe it.

118
00:08:28,229 --> 00:08:30,829
Even so... I...

119
00:08:30,829 --> 00:08:32,159
Even so... I...
You'll be forgiven.

120
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:35,859
Even if you're no longer a sibylla, that
doesn't mean you can't do certain things.

121
00:08:35,939 --> 00:08:37,959
Like forgiving one another...

122
00:08:38,509 --> 00:08:40,669
To forgive someone for wronging you...

123
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:42,669
...and to be forgiven in return.

124
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:45,169
If we can manage to do that much...

125
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:50,169
...I think we can still call ourselves
sibyllae even after we choose our gender.

126
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:54,019
Listen...

127
00:08:54,289 --> 00:08:56,759
I really do like you, Para-sama.

128
00:08:57,319 --> 00:09:00,289
My feelings for you won't change
whether I become a man or a woman.

129
00:09:00,459 --> 00:09:02,729
I don't think I'll ever
stop looking up to you!

130
00:09:06,499 --> 00:09:07,929
Thank you.

131
00:09:14,509 --> 00:09:17,909
They say that the high priestess
has been driven from the Arcus Prima.

132
00:09:19,179 --> 00:09:22,509
Aer, we don't have much time. You...

133
00:09:22,579 --> 00:09:24,679
What do you want me to say?

134
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:27,809
Never mind, don't answer
that. I already know.

135
00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:29,049
But...

136
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:31,519
I'm never gonna do it!

137
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:32,779
Aer?

138
00:09:32,859 --> 00:09:36,729
You just want to see Amuria again. That's
why you want to go to the other world!

139
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:39,789
I can't do a Ri Majon with you
if that's all you care about!

140
00:09:44,539 --> 00:09:47,869
Why did Onasia show that to me?

141
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:50,769
Never to feel another's embrace.

142
00:09:51,309 --> 00:09:53,439
And still...

143
00:09:53,609 --> 00:09:55,479
...I remain here.

144
00:09:56,349 --> 00:10:00,749
Onasia... Is she doomed
to stand there forever?

145
00:10:01,359 --> 00:10:03,549
Never to know forgiveness?

146
00:10:03,619 --> 00:10:05,489
Never to be saved?

147
00:10:08,299 --> 00:10:09,389
Yun?

148
00:10:10,429 --> 00:10:14,059
I thought that I should take
some of Mamina's things with me.

149
00:10:14,129 --> 00:10:16,759
Oh. Her trunk is under her bed.

150
00:10:20,139 --> 00:10:24,039
When I go home, I'll be
seeing Mamina's mother, so...

151
00:10:24,109 --> 00:10:26,079
I thought I could give them to her then.

152
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:29,769
Still smells like Mamina!

153
00:10:30,619 --> 00:10:32,589
It's not much...

154
00:10:33,249 --> 00:10:35,589
...but I hope Mamina's mother
will find comfort in this.

155
00:10:36,189 --> 00:10:40,989
I wonder... Is it even possible
for us to save anybody now?

156
00:10:44,969 --> 00:10:47,529
I'm sure it will be very difficult.

157
00:10:47,599 --> 00:10:50,399
We can barely take care
of ourselves as it is.

158
00:10:50,539 --> 00:10:53,299
But if we try our utmost,
then maybe we can save...

159
00:10:53,369 --> 00:10:55,069
...at least one person in this world.

160
00:10:55,139 --> 00:10:57,009
One person...

161
00:10:57,339 --> 00:10:59,109
Yun, is there someone in your life?

162
00:11:00,379 --> 00:11:02,109
That one person?

163
00:11:06,189 --> 00:11:07,619
Yun's gone?

164
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:12,359
Yes. I hear the highland soldiers
are looking for her, but...

165
00:11:12,429 --> 00:11:14,619
Why, Yun?

166
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:17,989
Maybe she decided she
didn't want to grow up.

167
00:11:18,169 --> 00:11:19,329
No, not Yun.

168
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:20,589
She...

169
00:11:20,999 --> 00:11:23,159
She must have realized...

170
00:11:23,239 --> 00:11:24,259
What?

171
00:11:24,339 --> 00:11:25,399
Oh, nothing.

172
00:11:25,469 --> 00:11:27,699
Oh, whatever! Being
such a stranger to us!

173
00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:29,639
She just got up and left
without saying a word!

174
00:11:29,709 --> 00:11:30,939
I know...

175
00:11:31,009 --> 00:11:34,909
...but once Chor Tempest is disbanded,
we'll all be going our separate ways.

176
00:11:39,849 --> 00:11:42,379
I have something to tell you all.

177
00:11:44,629 --> 00:11:46,819
About another world...

178
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:11,909
No way! Who knew the Emerald Ri
Majon could do something like that!

179
00:12:12,789 --> 00:12:15,809
Right, but that's precisely
what's going to save us.

180
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:22,789
Each of us is going to
choose a gender soon.

181
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:26,099
And our days on the Arcus
Prima will come to an end.

182
00:12:26,969 --> 00:12:30,869
But those two won't be choosing a
gender and will stay the way they are...

183
00:12:31,769 --> 00:12:33,669
Not choose a gender...

184
00:12:33,739 --> 00:12:35,469
...and stay the way they are?

185
00:12:36,579 --> 00:12:39,049
When the rest of us are all grown up...

186
00:12:39,109 --> 00:12:42,979
...and the emotions we carry
inside us now have faded...

187
00:12:43,449 --> 00:12:46,939
Those two will be
alive in another era...

188
00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:51,549
...somewhere in a sparkling world,
looking just as they do now.

189
00:12:53,989 --> 00:12:55,759
I need to talk to you.

190
00:12:56,999 --> 00:12:59,069
I get it. So those two will always...

191
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:00,029
I get it. So those two will always...
Right.

192
00:13:00,099 --> 00:13:02,329
Even after we've all become adults...

193
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,459
...they'll stay the same
for us for all time, right?

194
00:13:06,209 --> 00:13:08,299
The "eternal present"...

195
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:14,779
You don't have to go to the other
world with me if you don't want to.

196
00:13:14,849 --> 00:13:18,219
But whatever it is we decide,
we really should tell the others.

197
00:13:18,819 --> 00:13:20,679
That we're not going to the Spring...

198
00:13:20,749 --> 00:13:22,379
I don't need you to tell me that!

199
00:13:26,289 --> 00:13:29,389
I do want to know what
happened to Amuria.

200
00:13:29,859 --> 00:13:31,389
I do want to see her again.

201
00:13:31,669 --> 00:13:33,389
I can't lie to you about that.

202
00:13:34,369 --> 00:13:35,859
But...

203
00:13:40,239 --> 00:13:42,269
The one I'm in love with...

204
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:45,309
...is you.

205
00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:51,339
The one who lives facing life, rather
than death... It's you whom I love.

206
00:13:52,049 --> 00:13:56,349
The one who rescued me from the
darkness... It's you whom I love.

207
00:13:57,059 --> 00:13:59,749
The thought of going to that
other world frightens me.

208
00:14:00,129 --> 00:14:02,559
But if you and I are
together, then I'm sure...

209
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:03,819
Hold on.

210
00:14:04,459 --> 00:14:09,729
It's not that I wanted you to tell
me all about your feelings for me!

211
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,389
You don't need to give me an answer.

212
00:14:13,009 --> 00:14:15,129
I just thought that
I should let you know.

213
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:17,009
No...

214
00:14:17,109 --> 00:14:18,979
I wanted to let you know. That's all.

215
00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:21,709
Nothing more.

216
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:37,689
How am I supposed to take
that in all of a sudden?

217
00:14:39,599 --> 00:14:40,999
I don't understand!

218
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:45,569
The one I'm in love with... is you.

219
00:14:53,409 --> 00:14:54,639
Why is it...

220
00:14:56,019 --> 00:14:57,379
...so painful?

221
00:15:32,789 --> 00:15:37,749
To save the drifting spirits
of my fallen comrades...

222
00:15:38,929 --> 00:15:41,389
That's the one thing I've
always had on my mind.

223
00:15:41,929 --> 00:15:44,019
But deep down, I always knew the truth.

224
00:15:44,129 --> 00:15:47,069
That it's not possible
to save the dead...

225
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:49,959
But still...

226
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,829
There's one who even I...

227
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,169
No...

228
00:15:53,239 --> 00:15:58,409
What I realized was that there's one
person who can only be saved by me.

229
00:16:05,049 --> 00:16:07,849
For some reason, I'd hoped...

230
00:16:09,019 --> 00:16:11,649
...to hear those very words from you.

231
00:16:14,189 --> 00:16:17,219
I never chose a gender for myself.

232
00:16:17,729 --> 00:16:18,659
But...

233
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:22,459
I was not able to hold
on to my maiden's soul.

234
00:16:23,499 --> 00:16:27,099
And now, once again,
I am trying to escape.

235
00:16:27,169 --> 00:16:29,799
This time burdening you with
all my responsibilities...

236
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:32,369
No.

237
00:16:34,819 --> 00:16:36,909
You're beautiful.

238
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,379
You're beautiful...

239
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,979
I can hear quite a commotion out there.

240
00:17:55,059 --> 00:17:57,429
That voice... it must be Sibylla Floe.

241
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:06,139
Aer, were you planning
to stay in bed all day?

242
00:18:06,209 --> 00:18:08,939
It's our last day on the Arcus Prima!

243
00:18:11,579 --> 00:18:12,879
Wait for me, Alty!

244
00:18:12,949 --> 00:18:14,439
Not gonna happen!

245
00:18:14,579 --> 00:18:15,949
Please wait up!

246
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,919
Up here!

247
00:18:23,989 --> 00:18:25,419
It's an amazing view!

248
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:36,159
Come on, dance with me, Aer!

249
00:18:36,439 --> 00:18:38,169
Huh? Uh, I...

250
00:18:45,349 --> 00:18:47,699
Don't tell me that's...

251
00:19:26,719 --> 00:19:30,049
Please, let the Messis
transport you to the Spring.

252
00:19:30,719 --> 00:19:31,989
Thanks, but it's all right.

253
00:19:32,059 --> 00:19:36,189
I've always wanted to ride
on a helical-motor train.

254
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:38,689
I understand.

255
00:19:39,399 --> 00:19:43,129
May I ask what's going on with
Sibylla Neviril and Sibylla Aer?

256
00:19:43,369 --> 00:19:46,169
They have asked for a little more time.

257
00:19:47,339 --> 00:19:49,209
Fine.

258
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:50,909
All right then.

259
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:54,909
Farewell.

260
00:19:54,979 --> 00:19:58,139
We'll come back to say
hello when we're adults!

261
00:20:36,689 --> 00:20:39,319
The mountains are getting closer!

262
00:20:39,929 --> 00:20:41,989
It's almost time for lunch.

263
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:44,389
Oh, I almost forgot.

264
00:20:44,699 --> 00:20:49,099
I had them pack us something to eat
before we left. Is anybody hungry?

265
00:20:51,469 --> 00:20:52,399
Those look delicious!

266
00:20:52,509 --> 00:20:53,939
Me too! Me too!

267
00:20:54,009 --> 00:20:55,409
I'd like a vegetable sandwich.

268
00:20:55,479 --> 00:20:56,409
What about you, Roatre?

269
00:20:56,479 --> 00:20:58,099
A meat sandwich for me, please!

270
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,539
Same for me, please.

271
00:20:59,609 --> 00:21:01,579
Oh boy, I'm starving!

272
00:21:02,349 --> 00:21:03,939
This is so good!

273
00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:07,009
Okay, this is for Roatre.
This one's yours, Paraietta.

274
00:21:07,089 --> 00:21:07,449
Thanks.

275
00:21:07,449 --> 00:21:08,849
Thanks.
Man, why didn't you tell us sooner...

276
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:10,389
...that you had sandwiches?

277
00:21:11,219 --> 00:21:12,849
Come on, Floe!

278
00:22:23,029 --> 00:22:24,619
But that's...

279
00:22:26,199 --> 00:22:27,629
Yun!

280
00:22:41,379 --> 00:22:48,009
It is played by my wounds...
the song of prayer.

281
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:52,249
Let it ring out over
the grieving universe.

282
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:59,319
Can we change tomorrow?
Don't be afraid.

283
00:22:59,429 --> 00:23:06,999
I want to let you know
how my heart's overflowing.

284
00:23:15,819 --> 00:23:19,809
I want to get closer to you.
I want to feel your pulse.

285
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:24,979
I was too defiant,
and I took the long way around.

286
00:23:25,089 --> 00:23:28,959
The blue moon is swaying silently.

287
00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:32,999
My true heart's desire is you.

288
00:23:33,099 --> 00:23:38,869
I can't reach you.
My tears of pain trickle down.

289
00:23:38,969 --> 00:23:44,409
Soar away into the sky, song of prayer.

290
00:23:44,509 --> 00:23:47,839
Carrying my love that came too late.

291
00:23:47,949 --> 00:23:53,509
What can I do to change tomorrow?

292
00:23:53,619 --> 00:23:59,819
Just hold on to "now" the way it is...

293
00:24:05,199 --> 00:24:05,889
To Be Continued

294
00:24:05,969 --> 00:24:09,089
The girls embark on their
journey towards adulthood...

295
00:24:09,169 --> 00:24:12,659
...as Neviril and Aer head
towards the "eternal present."

296
00:24:14,439 --> 00:24:15,669
Next time on Simoun...

297
00:24:15,739 --> 00:24:16,739
Pair

298
00:24:16,739 --> 00:24:17,779
Pair
Pair.

299
00:24:17,779 --> 00:24:20,179
Pair
