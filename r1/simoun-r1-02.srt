1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:09,400
The countless flowers,
enveloped in light...

2
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:19,580
...gaze at tomorrow
with unwavering eyes.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,960
Everyone wishes for me to be pure...

4
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:46,370
...but what can I bring
with me to the frayed skies?

5
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:53,540
What I've made my own
by breaking off flowers in bloom...

6
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:59,190
All such sinful things...

7
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:06,630
Why did I stop making
promises with the future?

8
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:13,900
Because even if I try
to run far from all the pain...

9
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,600
...a cold wind rustles
my hair... Don't you see?

10
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:27,640
Where can I ever find the answer?

11
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,990
Just one.

12
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,860
You just said,
"This will be easy," didn't you?

13
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,340
That fool...

14
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:32,040
The Simile Simoun
is a Simoun prototype...

15
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:36,450
It hasn't received
the grace of Tempus Spatium.

16
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:39,280
It can't draw a Ri Majon wake.

17
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:47,290
The Blue Spring

18
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,760
Such beautiful lines.

19
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:59,500
Watch closely. M? U isn't just practice.

20
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:04,600
Because it'll be your souls and
bodies that control the Simouns' flight.

21
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:08,170
Sibylla Elly, why are
you dressed like that?

22
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:16,090
This is the last time I'll ever
see anything as beautiful as this.

23
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,600
That's the emerald pattern...

24
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,270
Impossible!

25
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,910
What's she thinking?

26
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,570
She's crazy!

27
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,880
Does this look like a real Simoun?

28
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,060
Where did you find her?

29
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,830
She enlisted.

30
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,570
Enlisted? That's hard to believe.

31
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:10,510
Who'd volunteer at a time like this,
knowing they'd have to go into battle?

32
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,560
That's...

33
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:59,320
Are you in Tempest too?
Nobody else joined the battle.

34
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,830
I was alone...

35
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,270
What were you thinking?

36
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,860
What were you thinking?
But I was alone...

37
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,400
Simulating the Emerald
Ri Majon of all things.

38
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,300
How would that make
Neviril feel if she saw it?

39
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:13,210
Was I doing a Ri Majon?

40
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,700
Who's Neviril?

41
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:21,980
When Simoun sibyllae take to the
skies, it's called praying to the skies.

42
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:25,450
Make sure you never
use the word battle again.

43
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,350
So who's Neviril?

44
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:36,460
Neviril is the regina of Chor Tempest.

45
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:41,630
Sibylla Aurea, the Golden Priestess!
I want to pair up with her!

46
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,170
No way...

47
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:46,270
Why not?
She's the top Simoun rider, right?

48
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,270
Simoun rider...

49
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,270
Yeah, till now.

50
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:53,780
But it might not be true anymore.

51
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:58,090
Because you're amazing!
I think I really like you.

52
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,090
Hey, why don't you pair up with me?

53
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,280
Listen, where's this Neviril?

54
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:40,190
It brings back memories.
When we were trainees...

55
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:44,160
...nothing made me happier
than waiting on you.

56
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,090
That hasn't changed one bit.

57
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,400
Dressed like that...
you're leaving the ship too?

58
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:54,970
Yes. Since it's been a long
time since my 17th birthday...

59
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:00,210
I've decided to go to the Spring.
And I have one last favor to ask...

60
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,940
What is it?

61
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,350
I'm afraid...

62
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,550
...of going to the Spring.

63
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,790
If you don't mind...

64
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:20,200
Of course, Elly.
I will accompany you.

65
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:24,200
Neviril! Anyone seen Neviril?

66
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,870
Have you seen Neviril?

67
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:30,070
Stop calling her that. Please...

68
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,570
...um, Aer.

69
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,350
This is Chor Tempest's
maintenance hangar.

70
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,220
Where's Neviril?

71
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,910
You here, Neviril?

72
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,650
This is the cafeteria.
And this is the ballroom.

73
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,230
Where's Neviril?

74
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,060
Wow!

75
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,230
This is the forward deck.

76
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,810
Neviril, what's the meaning of this?

77
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:03,170
Elly said she's going to the Spring.

78
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,480
She's unpaired at the moment,
so I'm accompanying her.

79
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,990
You're lying.
Then why are you taking luggage?

80
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,890
I haven't made up my mind yet.

81
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:21,490
So there's a chance that
I might enter the Spring as well.

82
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,070
If so...

83
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,000
But you can't...

84
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:28,500
You can't do that!
Because if you enter the Spring...

85
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,970
...that means you'll have Tempus
Spatium choose your gender, right?

86
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,540
It's none of your business.

87
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,040
Who are you?

88
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:40,880
Aer. Chor Tempest Simoun sibylla.

89
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,850
I'd like to pair up with you.

90
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:47,850
Those who are neither male
nor female can fly Simouns.

91
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,950
Now's our only chance.

92
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:53,860
Yet if you go to the Spring,
you can't be my pair.

93
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:57,420
She couldn't to begin with.

94
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:02,440
My 17th birthday
passed over a year ago.

95
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,510
You're an exceptional Simoun sibylla...

96
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:10,270
...and in this state of emergency,
the nation can't afford to lose you.

97
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:14,110
So Onasia has agreed not
to summon you to the Spring...

98
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,340
Please, Paraietta.

99
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:17,980
Let me go.

100
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,660
Please.

101
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:32,230
We are all born as females.

102
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:38,170
But to create a society,
half the population must be male.

103
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:42,700
Tempus Spatium has decreed
the world should be so.

104
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:48,550
Once we've turned 17, we're allowed
to choose our permanent gender.

105
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:53,920
But in the case of Simoun sibyllae,
this can be delayed.

106
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:58,790
Our nation, Kyuukoku, has gotten
invaded by countless countries.

107
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,590
Our only hope of battling
them are Simouns...

108
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,800
...and you sibyllae,
who can talk with the Simouns.

109
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:11,770
If you wish, you may delay
your pilgrimage to the Spring.

110
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:17,140
If, on the other hand, you yearn for
the Spring, we cannot stop you.

111
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,880
Especially Chor Tempest...

112
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:25,650
Since the war began, you and Chor
Caput have suffered great losses.

113
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,150
Those who've turned 17 are free
to choose the same path as Neviril.

114
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:33,630
There's no way I would.

115
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:38,060
Man or woman, I haven't
decided yet. I don't even want to.

116
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:42,540
As long as I'm in battle with a Simoun,
I won't have to go to the Spring.

117
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,070
That's why I came here.
Are you guys different?

118
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:50,570
No question.
Once you're of age, you have to go.

119
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,770
It means you're going
to become an adult.

120
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:58,080
But right now, the nation
needs our powers, so...

121
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,550
Oh? Is that right?

122
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:05,090
Then you've all already decided
to become a man or woman?

123
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,030
Have you, Big Sister?

124
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,380
Listen, you...

125
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,250
It's fine, Elly.

126
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,020
One last time...
Won't you pair up with me?

127
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:41,760
I want you to see me fly as
an auriga to the great temple below.

128
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:47,800
Then I'll have them
get a Simoun ready!

129
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,340
Well? How's my driving?

130
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,110
Not "driving,"
"speaking with the Simoun."

131
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,880
Oh, sorry. I'm just so psyched.

132
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:06,680
Because this is the first time
I've touched a real Simoun.

133
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,090
First time?

134
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,060
I've always wanted to ride one.

135
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,320
I've always wanted to ride one.
Really?

136
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:16,960
You know what I mean, don't you?

137
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,630
Everything has changed.

138
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,870
Because you're not "praying to
the skies" for Tempus Spatium...

139
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:26,100
...but for war?

140
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,870
Yes.

141
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,500
There's no difference.

142
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:32,080
You don't understand.

143
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:38,420
What kind...
What kind of place the battlefield is.

144
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:45,250
I do. Because I trained
on the front lines in the south.

145
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:52,100
Before the war, sibyllae would go to
the Spring when they turned 17, right?

146
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,570
Yes.

147
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:59,610
But now, the great temple's laws
say we don't have to go to the Spring.

148
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,240
As long as we're winning this war...

149
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,280
Thank you, Aer.

150
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,560
How rude. She's an auriga, right?

151
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,720
Yes.

152
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:28,570
So she made you fly as her sagitta?
The finest auriga in the nation?

153
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:45,580
Out of all of us here, is Paraietta
the only one who's turned 17?

154
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:50,690
Big Sister, you'll be
17 next month, right?

155
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,090
Either way, we all will be soon.

156
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:02,360
Aren't you going after Neviril?
You're going to become a man for her...

157
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:05,910
You made
that decision long ago, right?

158
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:10,340
I still feel that there are things
I need to accomplish here.

159
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,650
Elly, have you decided?

160
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,520
Which gender you'll
choose at the Spring.

161
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,530
Um, no.

162
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,430
I see.

163
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:07,470
I've always been female, so I think
it'd be more natural to stay one.

164
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:10,440
I might also want to become a male.

165
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:15,270
After all, there aren't a lot of job
opportunities unless you're a man.

166
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:23,640
I know you must be weary,
Simoun sibylla, but...

167
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,750
I don't mind.

168
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:32,790
Simoun sibylla...
Such a beautiful sight...

169
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:37,560
O priestess, please guide
our nation to the righteous path.

170
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,640
Please protect us.

171
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,480
Are you Neviril?

172
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,780
Yes.

173
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:05,480
If I'm with you,
I think I'll have fun flying.

174
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,800
O sibyllae...

175
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:54,340
We are overjoyed to know that
your time for prayer is now over.

176
00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:00,510
We thank you for having
protected us all thus far...

177
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,880
What should I do?

178
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:43,520
I'm supposed to think
"male" or "female" in my head...

179
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:47,190
...but what happens if I think of both?

180
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,860
You'll be fine.
There's nothing to worry about, Elly.

181
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,370
Onasia...

182
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,480
Great Priestess Onasia...

183
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:10,390
Forgive me for not journeying here
though my 17th birthday is long past.

184
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,540
Sibylla Elly, enter the Spring.

185
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:17,380
And offer a prayer...

186
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:01,070
No...

187
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,630
What should I do? I can't decide!

188
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:28,160
The holy sounds of Tempus Spatium
have just been bestowed upon you.

189
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:46,950
I was told that starting
today, my name is Eliph.

190
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:48,940
Yes.

191
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,680
Congratulations.

192
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:55,150
They say your voice
changes overtime...

193
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:59,320
...and your chest gets smaller, but...

194
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,330
Nothing's really changed, has it?

195
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,230
Right.

196
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:09,790
Nothing has changed, Eliph.

197
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,810
Well, Sibylla Roatreamon.

198
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:48,210
You're staying too, my lady?

199
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:53,340
I grew up being told
I should become a sibylla...

200
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:56,150
...so if I went home now,
they'd yell at me.

201
00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:00,090
We all have one, don't we? A reason...

202
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:18,400
The thing is...
I can't fly this alone, right?

203
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:51,930
You didn't go to the Spring?

204
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:55,840
I did go. But I decided not to enter.

205
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,680
Higher.

206
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,520
Than our ship?

207
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,650
Higher.

208
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:14,250
Please.

209
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:47,490
It is played by my wounds...
the song of prayer.

210
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,730
Let it ring out over
the grieving universe.

211
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:58,800
Can we change tomorrow?
Don't be afraid.

212
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:06,710
I want to let you know
how my heart's overflowing.

213
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:19,280
"I want to get closer to you."
"I want to feel your pulse."

214
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:24,420
I was too defiant,
and I took the long way around.

215
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:28,470
The blue moon is swaying silently.

216
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:32,470
My true heart's desire is you.

217
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:38,140
I can't reach you.
My tears of pain trickle down.

218
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:43,890
Soar away into the sky, song of prayer.

219
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:47,320
Carrying my love that came too late.

220
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:52,990
What can I do to change tomorrow?

221
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:59,470
Just hold on to "now" the way it is...

222
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,240
To Be Continued

223
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:11,180
Shoukoku's massive long-range cannons are
headed this way.

224
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,120
Next time on Simoun...

225
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,590
The Distant War
Next time on Simoun...

226
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:19,580
The Distant War
The Distant War.
