1
00:00:00,561 --> 00:00:09,531
The countless flowers,
enveloped in light...

2
00:00:09,641 --> 00:00:19,951
...gaze at tomorrow
with unwavering eyes.

3
00:00:32,131 --> 00:00:39,091
Everyone wishes for me to be pure...

4
00:00:39,401 --> 00:00:46,501
...but what can I bring
with me to the frayed skies?

5
00:00:46,611 --> 00:00:53,671
What I've made my own
by breaking off flowers in bloom...

6
00:00:53,951 --> 00:00:59,251
All such sinful things...

7
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:06,731
Why did I stop making
promises with the future?

8
00:01:06,831 --> 00:01:14,031
Because even if I try
to run far from all the pain...

9
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:20,701
...a cold wind rustles
my hair... Don't you see?

10
00:01:20,811 --> 00:01:28,221
Where can I ever find the answer?

11
00:01:30,621 --> 00:01:31,591
Hold on!

12
00:01:31,651 --> 00:01:32,521
Big Sister...

13
00:01:32,591 --> 00:01:36,791
I'm Para-sama's pair! You can't
just tell me to team up with Alty now.

14
00:01:36,891 --> 00:01:41,491
This is all for the sake of restoring
Chor Tempest to its former prestige.

15
00:01:44,831 --> 00:01:46,031
Neviril, look!

16
00:01:46,771 --> 00:01:47,891
What's happening?

17
00:01:48,001 --> 00:01:51,491
Why aren't their prayers
being heard by the Simoun gem?

18
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:52,661
Kaim!

19
00:01:52,771 --> 00:01:53,601
Big Sister!

20
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:57,151
Don't call me that!
I said stop calling me that!

21
00:01:57,151 --> 00:02:03,111
Reason

22
00:02:21,901 --> 00:02:23,031
Their prayers?

23
00:02:23,141 --> 00:02:27,701
Yes, the divine vehicles are
activated by Simoun sibylla prayers.

24
00:02:27,811 --> 00:02:32,271
The two priestesses are joined in
spirit as they honor Tempus Spatium.

25
00:02:35,581 --> 00:02:40,281
To reject the one you're paired with
is the same as rejecting the Simoun.

26
00:02:44,191 --> 00:02:48,291
I really find that hard to believe.
We've never heard such a thing.

27
00:02:48,901 --> 00:02:53,431
I'm only speculating.
Even so, thanks to your efforts...

28
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:57,271
...we were able to discover
a secret aspect of the Simouns.

29
00:02:57,371 --> 00:02:58,811
Well done...

30
00:02:59,271 --> 00:03:02,041
...or would that be
inappropriate to say?

31
00:03:02,811 --> 00:03:04,471
What this means...

32
00:03:05,581 --> 00:03:10,381
...is that my sister and I won't be
able to fly as a pair anymore, right?

33
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:15,451
Do you think you
can understand why not?

34
00:03:15,521 --> 00:03:16,821
Yes.

35
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:29,831
No enemies in sight, huh?

36
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:31,601
Oh, boy!

37
00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:36,081
I'm so bored to death it feels
like I'm gonna get moldy all over!

38
00:03:36,711 --> 00:03:37,841
Pow!

39
00:03:39,381 --> 00:03:42,141
In other words,
you'd rather we were at war?

40
00:03:42,251 --> 00:03:46,351
I never said that.
It's just that there's nothing to do.

41
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:51,261
Such sinful thoughts should be
banished from your mind right away.

42
00:03:53,631 --> 00:03:56,761
Oh, I'm so bored! I'm so bored!

43
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:07,441
She doesn't look it, but Roatreamon
can be scary when she gets mad.

44
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,201
Don't look at me.

45
00:04:17,451 --> 00:04:19,681
What are you thinking about?

46
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:22,591
Something that's not on your mind.

47
00:04:23,461 --> 00:04:24,891
I see.

48
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:27,291
The Emerald Ri Majon?

49
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:31,491
Right, the ultimate Ri Majon
that can be achieved by a Simoun.

50
00:04:31,601 --> 00:04:34,631
They say it can inscribe
the final miracle on earth.

51
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:35,901
Final?

52
00:04:38,741 --> 00:04:41,771
Simulating the Emerald
Ri Majon of all things.

53
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:45,141
How would that make
Neviril feel if she saw it?

54
00:04:46,381 --> 00:04:48,111
Was I doing a Ri Majon?

55
00:04:48,451 --> 00:04:50,251
I get it now.

56
00:04:50,351 --> 00:04:53,221
So that's what that was all about.

57
00:04:53,661 --> 00:04:54,851
Aer?

58
00:04:55,861 --> 00:04:56,521
Aer.

59
00:04:56,521 --> 00:04:57,991
Aer.
Hey, tell me...

60
00:04:58,091 --> 00:04:59,421
What happens?

61
00:04:59,531 --> 00:05:02,991
Unfortunately,
I've never seen it before myself.

62
00:05:03,101 --> 00:05:05,591
Waporif, didn't Neviril and Amuria...

63
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:19,901
So Neviril and Amuria did it.
The Emerald Ri Majon...

64
00:05:20,421 --> 00:05:21,681
Well...

65
00:05:21,781 --> 00:05:24,341
I get it! They didn't succeed.

66
00:05:27,091 --> 00:05:28,081
That's right.

67
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:31,121
So that's it. Not with Amuria...

68
00:05:49,481 --> 00:05:51,881
Oh my! You're so thorough!

69
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:54,871
The god
Tempus Spatium is a neat freak.

70
00:05:54,981 --> 00:05:58,381
If the water's murky,
Tempus Spatium won't come near.

71
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:00,391
That's what Mother said.

72
00:06:00,491 --> 00:06:04,361
According to her, misfortune seeps in
through dirty kitchens and bathtubs.

73
00:06:04,461 --> 00:06:08,661
You're amazing. You know so
many things I've never heard of.

74
00:06:08,761 --> 00:06:10,891
Maybe it best suits me.

75
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:14,701
Cleaning house
like this, cooking meals...

76
00:06:16,341 --> 00:06:19,401
Maybe I was only
dreaming for a moment.

77
00:06:19,571 --> 00:06:23,271
It's so stuck on I can barely
scrape it off! If we had citrus...

78
00:06:23,381 --> 00:06:24,541
Citrus?

79
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:26,711
The acid rubs stains away.

80
00:06:26,811 --> 00:06:29,371
As I said, you're amazing!

81
00:06:50,571 --> 00:06:52,231
It's delicious!

82
00:07:03,851 --> 00:07:05,011
Neviril!

83
00:07:06,251 --> 00:07:09,051
Do it with me! The Emerald Ri Majon!

84
00:07:16,231 --> 00:07:17,821
Aer! You...

85
00:07:17,931 --> 00:07:20,961
I know.
It was a bust with Amuria, right?

86
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:26,671
I know I'll work out. Come on,
Neviril, let's do the Emerald...

87
00:07:26,771 --> 00:07:27,971
Stop it!

88
00:07:36,821 --> 00:07:37,881
Wait.

89
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:40,281
I'll get something to wipe that up.

90
00:07:43,091 --> 00:07:44,651
Neviril, you okay?

91
00:07:44,761 --> 00:07:46,061
Shut up, Aer.

92
00:07:46,161 --> 00:07:46,961
Why?

93
00:07:47,061 --> 00:07:49,151
We just don't talk about that...

94
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:54,301
Because it reminds
you of Amuria's death?

95
00:08:05,581 --> 00:08:06,911
Neviril!

96
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:16,511
That was just going too far.

97
00:08:17,491 --> 00:08:19,791
I feel so sorry for Neviril.

98
00:08:22,831 --> 00:08:24,921
I never knew Amuria personally.

99
00:08:25,031 --> 00:08:28,661
But to speak ill of
the dead is an unforgivable sin.

100
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,031
Come on. I was only...

101
00:08:31,141 --> 00:08:32,571
Come with me.

102
00:08:37,611 --> 00:08:38,671
Aer...

103
00:08:52,461 --> 00:08:54,591
Why'd you bring me here?

104
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:58,391
Jeez.
Listen, do you love Neviril or not?

105
00:08:58,731 --> 00:09:00,031
I love her.

106
00:09:00,501 --> 00:09:01,871
Not like that...

107
00:09:01,971 --> 00:09:03,201
Then how?

108
00:09:03,301 --> 00:09:08,301
Wishing to chat just a second more
or hold her tight and feel her warmth...

109
00:09:08,411 --> 00:09:12,041
The kind of love where you
desire her more than anything.

110
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:14,111
I desire Neviril.

111
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:18,681
If I'm with Neviril,
I know I can fly higher than anyone.

112
00:09:20,921 --> 00:09:21,981
Aer.

113
00:09:26,061 --> 00:09:27,051
Well?

114
00:09:27,131 --> 00:09:28,101
Well what?

115
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:29,561
How'd it feel?

116
00:09:29,661 --> 00:09:32,931
Since we're not about
to go into battle, it felt weird!

117
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:38,301
When you stop feeling that way,
it'll mean you're really in love!

118
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:42,141
Neviril was in love with Amuria.
Do you get what I'm saying?

119
00:09:42,241 --> 00:09:45,771
What does that have to do
with the Emerald Ri Majon?

120
00:09:46,951 --> 00:09:50,041
It's better in all kinds
of ways when you're in love!

121
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:56,751
Neviril!

122
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:00,621
Neviril!

123
00:10:01,961 --> 00:10:03,451
Neviril!

124
00:10:06,401 --> 00:10:07,921
Neviril...

125
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:11,101
Neviril.

126
00:10:17,011 --> 00:10:19,341
Don't worry. It'll happen with us.

127
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:23,381
We can do it.

128
00:10:42,901 --> 00:10:44,841
The Emerald Ri Majon!

129
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:50,371
Amuria...

130
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:55,121
Because it reminds
you of Amuria's death?

131
00:10:59,651 --> 00:11:01,991
Neviril! What's wrong, Neviril?

132
00:11:02,091 --> 00:11:03,391
Neviril!

133
00:11:03,691 --> 00:11:05,181
Neviril!

134
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,291
Neviril!

135
00:11:41,231 --> 00:11:43,031
I'll open the window.

136
00:11:45,501 --> 00:11:48,161
It's horribly dusty in here, but Aer...

137
00:11:48,271 --> 00:11:51,711
You'd rather not be in the same
room with everybody, right?

138
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:53,801
Yes. Thank you.

139
00:11:56,381 --> 00:11:59,281
All right... you get some rest now.

140
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:25,701
The Emerald Ri Majon...

141
00:12:26,911 --> 00:12:29,031
It must be incredible.

142
00:12:30,311 --> 00:12:33,211
I'd like to try it too.

143
00:12:33,881 --> 00:12:35,641
With Dominüra?

144
00:12:36,451 --> 00:12:39,481
I don't really mind who I do it with...

145
00:12:39,591 --> 00:12:41,891
Do you love Dominüra, Rimone?

146
00:12:43,121 --> 00:12:44,791
I don't know.

147
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:51,761
If you do, then you'll want to kiss even
when you're not in a Simoun, I hear.

148
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:55,561
I hear it's better in all
ways when you're in love.

149
00:12:55,671 --> 00:12:56,901
All kinds?

150
00:12:57,001 --> 00:12:59,341
Right, all kinds.

151
00:13:11,221 --> 00:13:13,241
What did the Powers That Be say?

152
00:13:13,351 --> 00:13:17,121
That so long as the enemy's idle,
we'll take a wait-and-see approach.

153
00:13:17,221 --> 00:13:20,721
After discovering that aerial base,
they're saying to let it go?

154
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:24,891
It seems an unexpected crisis
occurred aboard the Arcus Prima...

155
00:13:25,001 --> 00:13:27,231
...and everything's in chaos.

156
00:13:27,331 --> 00:13:28,731
As I thought...

157
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:32,601
...the here and now is so distracting
that they're missing the big picture.

158
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:35,201
If this goes on, Kyuukoku will...

159
00:13:35,311 --> 00:13:37,471
Sibylla Dominüra...

160
00:13:37,881 --> 00:13:41,611
If I may, you seem
to be in some kind of rush.

161
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:45,671
Far be it from me to presume
such things of a sibylla...

162
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:48,411
Yes, I would say that's accurate.

163
00:13:59,931 --> 00:14:00,991
Rimone.

164
00:14:01,101 --> 00:14:04,001
What's the matter?
Is there some problem?

165
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,741
What is it?

166
00:14:10,241 --> 00:14:11,971
What did you think?

167
00:14:13,651 --> 00:14:15,741
Did you feel like you were in love?

168
00:14:24,761 --> 00:14:26,661
Run along now.

169
00:14:41,641 --> 00:14:44,511
Amuria is... dead.

170
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:47,271
Neviril?

171
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:50,071
Neviril?

172
00:14:50,651 --> 00:14:52,081
Neviril!

173
00:14:54,321 --> 00:14:56,311
I was looking for you.

174
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:00,421
But why?

175
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,861
Whoops-a-daisy.

176
00:15:02,961 --> 00:15:04,791
Now wait a minute...

177
00:15:04,901 --> 00:15:06,871
You're not feeling well?

178
00:15:14,311 --> 00:15:16,401
Look at me, will you?

179
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:22,711
You could choke in this room.
It's full of old junk.

180
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:25,751
There's no air circulation.
All that's left...

181
00:15:25,851 --> 00:15:28,751
...is useless memories, nothing more.

182
00:15:32,591 --> 00:15:34,251
Let's go outside.

183
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:39,061
We've got to go.
Let's open the door together, Neviril.

184
00:15:42,171 --> 00:15:43,191
Neviril...

185
00:15:58,651 --> 00:16:00,641
What are you doing?

186
00:16:06,191 --> 00:16:08,131
T-That hurts, you know!

187
00:16:08,231 --> 00:16:11,031
Neviril's exhausted. Get out of here.

188
00:16:11,131 --> 00:16:12,391
Huh? But...

189
00:16:12,501 --> 00:16:14,691
I said get out of here!

190
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:31,611
Neviril, I don't think Aer
means you any harm. But...

191
00:16:31,721 --> 00:16:32,981
I want...

192
00:16:33,751 --> 00:16:35,621
...to get some sleep now.

193
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,491
Do you mind?

194
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:40,691
N-No.

195
00:17:04,121 --> 00:17:05,241
Where's Aer?

196
00:17:05,651 --> 00:17:06,641
Who knows?

197
00:17:06,951 --> 00:17:10,011
What she said was
shocking, don't you think?

198
00:17:11,261 --> 00:17:13,781
It's not just Neviril.

199
00:17:13,891 --> 00:17:17,261
All this time, the rest
of us were avoiding it too.

200
00:17:18,301 --> 00:17:20,391
Saying those words out loud...

201
00:17:20,501 --> 00:17:24,901
Because if we did, it felt as though
we'd never be able to move on.

202
00:17:26,611 --> 00:17:28,841
Amuria was so strong.

203
00:17:29,311 --> 00:17:33,681
Always looking skyward...
She never seemed unsure of herself.

204
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:38,681
Yes, war was something
I never thought I could handle...

205
00:17:40,021 --> 00:17:43,291
...but if she was there,
I thought we couldn't lose.

206
00:17:43,421 --> 00:17:45,791
That's how she made me feel.

207
00:17:45,891 --> 00:17:49,091
That's why I was afraid to admit it.

208
00:17:49,761 --> 00:17:53,261
No, I still don't want
to admit it, even now.

209
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:54,661
But...

210
00:18:03,841 --> 00:18:04,901
What's this?

211
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:08,111
Uh, guess I'm busted.

212
00:18:09,681 --> 00:18:10,841
What is it?

213
00:18:13,691 --> 00:18:15,421
What's up with that?

214
00:18:22,431 --> 00:18:23,201
That's awful!

215
00:18:23,201 --> 00:18:24,991
That's awful!
What kind of animal is that?

216
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:26,031
So funny...

217
00:18:26,101 --> 00:18:28,731
Excuse me!
I worked really hard sewing it!

218
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:31,331
Sure, I made him a little uglier, but...

219
00:18:31,441 --> 00:18:34,101
Looks like he's already met his doom.

220
00:18:34,811 --> 00:18:37,401
No, he hasn't. He's so sweet!

221
00:18:37,851 --> 00:18:41,141
I guess you could
say he took after his creator.

222
00:18:41,451 --> 00:18:42,641
Hey, you.

223
00:19:00,701 --> 00:19:03,571
I never wanted to hurt Neviril.

224
00:19:04,271 --> 00:19:08,801
It's just that I felt if we were together,
we could accomplish anything.

225
00:19:08,911 --> 00:19:11,571
How can you be so sure of yourself?

226
00:19:13,311 --> 00:19:16,181
Have you never
experienced utter despair?

227
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:21,021
If I had, what good would it do?

228
00:19:26,061 --> 00:19:30,191
Entrusting Neviril to you
may have been a mistake.

229
00:19:41,141 --> 00:19:43,841
We can't afford to wait
for orders from above.

230
00:19:43,941 --> 00:19:48,111
Now that the enemy's idle,
we must investigate that aerial base.

231
00:19:48,221 --> 00:19:51,211
Neviril, Aer, I leave this to you.

232
00:19:52,521 --> 00:19:54,251
Wait, these two are...

233
00:19:54,351 --> 00:19:57,851
Those two are, at the moment,
Chor Tempest's top pair.

234
00:19:57,961 --> 00:19:59,451
What is the issue?

235
00:19:59,561 --> 00:20:00,581
But...

236
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:06,131
Dominüra, I'm not in a place
where I can team up with Aer.

237
00:20:07,171 --> 00:20:09,691
You said so
yesterday, right? The Simouns...

238
00:20:09,801 --> 00:20:11,931
That's precisely why.

239
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:16,241
People's emotions aren't toys!
If you're speculating...

240
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:17,541
Neviril...

241
00:20:18,981 --> 00:20:21,881
I... want to fly with you.

242
00:20:25,021 --> 00:20:27,451
Maybe you don't want to...

243
00:20:27,891 --> 00:20:29,321
...but I...

244
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,021
Neviril...

245
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:36,321
I want you to put
Kyuukoku above all else.

246
00:20:36,731 --> 00:20:40,331
We are Simoun sibyllae after all.

247
00:21:10,701 --> 00:21:11,861
Worried?

248
00:21:19,671 --> 00:21:20,971
I knew it was futile.

249
00:21:20,971 --> 00:21:22,741
I knew it was futile.
It's not futile.

250
00:21:23,441 --> 00:21:26,381
It's not futile.
You and I will be able to fly.

251
00:21:26,481 --> 00:21:27,911
You and I...

252
00:21:43,061 --> 00:21:45,031
Their prayers were heard, it seems.

253
00:21:45,131 --> 00:21:47,831
So emotional stuff had
nothing to do with it, right?

254
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:53,341
That's not possible. The only
explanation would be that Neviril...

255
00:21:53,911 --> 00:21:55,501
Neviril...

256
00:22:03,921 --> 00:22:05,011
But why?

257
00:22:07,991 --> 00:22:11,751
I knew it. You're seeking me after all.

258
00:22:15,301 --> 00:22:19,231
You can fly if you're with me.
You can do it if you're with me.

259
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:22,731
Am I really seeking Aer?

260
00:22:23,741 --> 00:22:25,301
Surely not...

261
00:22:25,411 --> 00:22:28,241
Because I... Because I...

262
00:22:30,441 --> 00:22:34,211
Because I'm afraid of Aer.

263
00:22:41,051 --> 00:22:47,691
It is played by my wounds...
the song of prayer.

264
00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:51,921
Let it ring out over
the grieving universe.

265
00:22:52,031 --> 00:22:58,961
Can we change tomorrow?
Don't be afraid.

266
00:22:59,071 --> 00:23:06,741
I want to let you know
how my heart's overflowing.

267
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:19,481
"I want to get closer to you."
"I want to feel your pulse."

268
00:23:19,591 --> 00:23:24,661
I was too defiant,
and I took the long way around.

269
00:23:24,771 --> 00:23:28,671
The blue moon is swaying silently.

270
00:23:28,771 --> 00:23:32,601
My true heart's desire is you.

271
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:38,541
I can't reach you.
My tears of pain trickle down.

272
00:23:38,651 --> 00:23:44,021
Soar away into the sky, song of prayer.

273
00:23:44,121 --> 00:23:47,481
Carrying my love that came too late.

274
00:23:47,591 --> 00:23:53,181
What can I do to change tomorrow?

275
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:59,461
Just hold on to "now" the way it is...

276
00:24:04,541 --> 00:24:05,871
To Be Continued

277
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:11,171
Are you telling me to dismantle
a Simoun, Sibylla Dominüra?

278
00:24:14,111 --> 00:24:15,251
Next time on Simoun...

279
00:24:15,251 --> 00:24:16,751
Sacrosanct
Next time on Simoun...

280
00:24:16,751 --> 00:24:18,591
Sacrosanct
Sacrosanct.

281
00:24:18,591 --> 00:24:19,241
Sacrosanct
