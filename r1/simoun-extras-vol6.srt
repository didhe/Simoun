1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:00,734
<i>Junji and Asako's</i>
<i>Know-Your-Simoun Lecture</i>

2
00:00:00,734 --> 00:00:03,203
<i>Junji and Asako's</i>
<i>Know-Your-Simoun Lecture</i>
Jun-Jun and Asa-Asa's...

3
00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:05,305
<i>Junji and Asako's</i>
<i>Know-Your-Simoun Lecture</i>
...Radio Wave Illusion!

4
00:00:05,305 --> 00:00:06,363
...Radio Wave Illusion!

5
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:13,473
We began with a title not discussed in
the meeting. It's the Simoun lecture.

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:14,911
Part one, right?

7
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,116
This is the director...

8
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:17,913
This is the director...
The director, Nishimura...

9
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,849
Junji-sensei.

10
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:23,047
And I'm Asako Nishida,
the character designer.

11
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:26,421
I also serve as animation supervisor.

12
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,686
And also light comic relief...

13
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:34,426
...but right now, I'm in
charge of Wauf love. And so...

14
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:40,869
The conductor of love who conveys
Wauf's allure to all our viewers.

15
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:45,904
This has nothing to do
with what's on screen!

16
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:49,209
Well, if you see
the Messis, you think of Wauf...

17
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:51,249
I came up with Wauf's name.

18
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:53,182
Oh? What does it mean?

19
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:57,518
Well, basically, all male names
are supposed to end with an F...

20
00:00:57,624 --> 00:01:00,388
That was one of
the rules, as you know...

21
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:01,517
So "Wau"?

22
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:03,994
No, to be honest...

23
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:08,431
Since Wauf's a minor character,
I thought a short name would do.

24
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:10,969
You mean <i>that</i> was your reason?

25
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,834
Are you kidding?

26
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:17,842
I looked it up in a Latin dictionary,
wondering if it had some meaning...

27
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:20,845
Actually, in the case of the Messis...

28
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:23,643
...it means grain or something similar.

29
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:28,153
As for "Wauf," I just decided
on it by the way it sounded.

30
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:31,712
Like the sound you make
when you're kissing... Wauf!

31
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:37,127
Like, "What's with that?" Anyway, we'll
go back to the topic of Wauf later...

32
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,255
At this point...

33
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:43,199
...was this where
Neviril's love affair begins?

34
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:50,300
Yes. Needless to say,
around episodes seven and eight...

35
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:57,915
...Neviril actually begins to have
feelings to some degree forAer.

36
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:01,745
That was my intention for
this part. The thing is, though...

37
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:03,322
Seven and eight?

38
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:07,757
When she said pair...
"You are my pair." That was when...

39
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:10,295
Actually, she said, "I am your pair!"

40
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:11,556
Right.

41
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:15,193
That's right.

42
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,132
"I am your pair."

43
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:23,700
I tried to convey how she didn't
realize her feelings at the time.

44
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:28,711
And after that, it was a matter
of figuring out how to make Neviril...

45
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:32,842
...realize that she
was in love with Aer.

46
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,354
That was the story arc
I wanted to build.

47
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:42,322
Aerjust thought she
should follow Floe's words.

48
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:46,091
Just kissing her if there was
a Ri M_a_jon she'd like to invent.

49
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,928
Thinking like a child, right?

50
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:51,936
Since Aer has no complex
emotions like Neviril does...

51
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:59,275
But anyway, we shouldn't be
talking about stuff so far ahead.

52
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:04,040
Wait. She's now like, "What
good will it do to lose all hope?"

53
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,742
I assumed...

54
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:10,755
...she was implying that she'd already
seen her share of hopelessness.

55
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:11,558
Is that right?

56
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:14,254
Is that right?
Yes, um...

57
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:18,988
You once asked me, "Just what
did Aer go through before all this?"

58
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:19,933
Yeah.

59
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,594
Yeah.
Remember?

60
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:27,263
She's probably seen more than
anyone should in a lifetime.

61
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,398
Like in episode four...

62
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:32,945
...she's done things like
hacking a soldierto pieces.

63
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:38,006
She's been in an environment
more harsh than one should be in?

64
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:39,550
That's it.

65
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:40,880
Ah...

66
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:47,382
So she's only seen
the negative aspects of this world?

67
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:51,624
Negative aspects?
I don't know if you'd...

68
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:54,258
It's not about pluses or minuses...

69
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:59,703
It's simply that she knows that there
are harsh environments like that.

70
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:06,407
So it's not like she's known hardship
and wants to go to a better place...

71
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:09,777
It's more that she's
aware and can remain calm.

72
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:13,978
That's the nuance I was going for.

73
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:21,787
I really want to draw that Aer who's
so gung-ho about going into battle.

74
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:25,295
Very well.
That will come up next time.

75
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:26,558
Next time?

76
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,597
You mean in episode 27?

77
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:36,200
In that sense,
seeing Aer in a scene like this...

78
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:40,040
I mean Neviril...
And Paraietta's relationship...

79
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:44,048
You can see that it's
a little... How should I say it?

80
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:49,485
It seems more like they're playing
house. It's that nuance that I like.

81
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,788
You mean it still hasn't
evolved into a true romance?

82
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:57,795
Like two kids pretending.

83
00:04:57,897 --> 00:05:00,991
You're pretty much
hitting it on the nose there.

84
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:05,537
And I felt that we should
keep it that way between them.

85
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:08,237
These scenes here...

86
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:10,673
Afterthe first approval...

87
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:15,339
...we were told, "Make Domin_u_ra
more drop-dead gorgeous!"

88
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:19,612
That was a direct request from
the director. You left me a little note.

89
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:21,346
And you complied?

90
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:27,659
Domin_u_ra's character... At what point
did you really start getting into...

91
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,991
...or should I say
focusing more on her?

92
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:35,995
Domin_u_ra? Well, what can I say...

93
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:41,872
In the end, it's really Domin_u_ra
who's most like an outsider.

94
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:45,441
Um... A-Aer, on the other hand...

95
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:50,983
...came from outside, began shaking
things up, and <i>is</i> a sort of heretic.

96
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:54,918
But Aer herself doesn't have
a problem with that at all.

97
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,785
But that's not
the case with Domin_u_ra.

98
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:00,859
She knows that she's an outsider...

99
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,522
...and you can see that it's causing
her distress. That's my take.

100
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:11,865
But she also knows she can only go
so far and is resigned to that fact.

101
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:14,030
That's the kind of person she is.

102
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:18,076
And that's the kind of mind-set
I had myself when I was a kid.

103
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:18,845
Oh, is that right?

104
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:20,179
Oh, is that right?
I can relate to her kind of character.

105
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:22,044
I can relate to her kind of character.

106
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:25,311
You felt isolated, you mean?

107
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:28,883
Oh, I wouldn't say isolated.

108
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:32,583
So you had those drills
hanging from your head too?

109
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,090
Just like her!

110
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:36,024
The bamboo curls!

111
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:38,723
That's something
from my secret past.

112
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:41,295
I went through that for a while.

113
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:49,639
The background music in
this scene is pretty interesting.

114
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:55,036
Right, it really stands out like a sore
thumb on the CD! At least to me!

115
00:06:56,215 --> 00:06:59,013
Because the other
songs are tango-esque, etc.

116
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:04,021
Then this mechanical-sounding
background music is suddenly heard.

117
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:08,082
I knew it would be
a challenge, but it fit like a glove.

118
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:09,855
Whoa... goosebumps!

119
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:16,562
So in your eyes,
Wauf was just a minor character?

120
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:18,569
Yes, that's right.

121
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:21,069
Oh, time out.

122
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:24,333
Sorry, Wauf.
We'll get back to you later!

123
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:26,803
This kiss here...

124
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:27,846
Yes?

125
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:31,315
Is shejust repeating
what Aer told her...

126
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:33,643
...or was she being mischievous?

127
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:38,986
No, she's truly acting on it in
all seriousness... The way a child will.

128
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:43,960
So she's just a really pure-minded
character. No motives at all.

129
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:49,023
In the beginning, Rimone was always
trying to shun Domin_u_ra, right?

130
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:54,439
But now she's attracted to her...
Did she sense her motherly instinct?

131
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:59,910
Or did she see her as a person trying
to achieve perfection in one thing...

132
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:03,106
...and that was what drew her?

133
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:06,413
Forgive me...
I really don't understand Rimone.

134
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,646
Hey, you're copping out!

135
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:12,390
Jun-Jun totally copped out!

136
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:16,023
R-Rimone's the one
I can relate to the least!

137
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:20,861
You've alienated every last Rimone
fan in Japan, all across the country.

138
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:22,127
You're finished.

139
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:26,633
Watching the show,
you may think that about her...

140
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:30,971
...but for me, Rimone is something
I have to handle with kid gloves.

141
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:34,843
Something about her keeps
me from answering promptly.

142
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:38,348
If you're too invested,
you'd be committing a crime.

143
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:40,646
So you're using restraint?

144
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:44,348
I'm just saying I don't
understand her as a character!

145
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:49,185
But doesn't that make
you want to know her all the more?

146
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:55,427
In that sense, the whole issue
is a pretty scary one for me.

147
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,629
I'd be scared to try to figure her out...

148
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:04,540
She's a "No offense, but I don't
think I'll touch you" kind of character.

149
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:09,472
So all your excess passion
is channeled into Domin_u_ra.

150
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:12,745
Into the bamboo curls.

151
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:15,582
I think that's
what happened, more or less.

152
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:20,984
But these two... Of course
when we first started out...

153
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:25,052
...we never intended for
them to go into this direction.

154
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:29,198
It's more like they headed
down that path on their own.

155
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:30,826
Pretty much...

156
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:37,669
Here, she's talking about
the fact that she's an immigrant.

157
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:40,746
You told me this over drinks last night.

158
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:47,513
What it means to be an immigrant...

159
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:52,384
Whether it means you're from
another country or another planet?

160
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:55,619
You mean that discussion we had.

161
00:09:56,929 --> 00:10:03,926
The geography we're talking about...
In a historical sense, as well as...

162
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:07,494
I guess I should
say a physical sense...

163
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:11,666
You can think of it as
encompassing all of outer space.

164
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:16,578
I do believe that, but in
the 26-episode Simoun worldview...

165
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:23,281
...there's no need for viewers
to expand their perception that much.

166
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:29,853
And if it were, we'd be opening a can
of worms without resolving a thing.

167
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:33,261
And we still haven't
resolved anything to this day...

168
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:34,492
You said it!

169
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,500
I think that would happen.

170
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:41,835
But my imagined world has space
and immigrants from other planets.

171
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:44,705
That's the kind of worldview
I'm hoping to create.

172
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:48,576
Matsuda-san, use space engine
background music right here.

173
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:54,450
I see...

174
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:59,886
Right here in this scene is
precisely where we see Domin_u_ra...

175
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,222
The birth of "Drill-nura"!

176
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:07,231
Drill-nura is born! That's what I was
thinking when we did this scene.

177
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:14,671
In the first draft of the script, you
see her coming barefoot towards us.

178
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:18,365
And right after that,
she's stuffing herself with food.

179
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:23,346
Oh, so making her only wearthat slip
in those scenes was your doing?

180
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:28,645
More or less. So we had the script,
character design, and costumes...

181
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:32,212
...and it seemed she
kept sliding towards drilldom.

182
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:36,158
I get a strong sense of that
in this episode's second half.

183
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:42,030
When you see her stroking
Rimone's cheek in this scene...

184
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:45,900
...the segment director said,
"Try to make it look like it feels good."

185
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:48,303
"You know, like it's a crime!"

186
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,478
I was like, "Gotcha!"
That's what happened.

187
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,046
I wasn't consulted.

188
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:58,514
Are you serious?
I was totally gung-ho about it...

189
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:02,747
And I made it look as criminal
as possible. At least in my eyes.

190
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,720
Pretty criminal right here.

191
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:14,723
Everything's spiraling out of control
without the director's knowledge.

192
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:17,631
Itjust keeps snowballing.

193
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:22,633
Oh, wait...

194
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:26,371
As far as what happens when
you do the Emerald Ri M_a_jon...

195
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:31,007
At this point in the story,
does Domin_u_ra herself know?

196
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:32,345
No.

197
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:35,844
She may know
that it's one possibility...

198
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:41,587
...but basically, all she's sure of is
that she won't know unless she tries.

199
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:47,030
They're surrounded by enemies,
and it's a matter of life or death...

200
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:52,033
Just what is her motivation
for doing the Emerald Ri M_a_jon?

201
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:55,200
Does she think
they can change the tide?

202
00:12:55,307 --> 00:13:00,108
No, she has a more...
It's a very personal reason.

203
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:07,015
She knows that this battle
means nothing to them anymore.

204
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:13,291
They'll get killed if she doesn't do
something now, so it's now or never?

205
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:19,922
Well, um, we'll continue
this discussion later. I think.

206
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:21,192
What?

207
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:25,198
Are you serious?

208
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:31,932
W-We're ending on this doll?
Roatreamon's doll will close it out?

209
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:35,275
Um, as far as
the Emerald Ri M_a_jon is concerned...

210
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:39,283
...we still have an immense
amount of explaining to do.

211
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:42,580
How should I say it?

212
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:48,187
The fact that they did
the Emerald Ri M_a_jon here...

213
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:53,496
...was a huge catalyst that moved
this story towards its conclusion.

214
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:58,696
And we really do need to talk
about the structure of this arc.

215
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:02,205
No, I mean
Domin_u_ra's emotional state!

216
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:04,742
That's what you're talking about!

217
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,472
About Domin_u_ra's emotional state...

218
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:13,448
The moment she drew herself up
to her full height in that scene...

219
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:24,418
She'd made up her mind totally to live
the rest of her life with Rimone...

220
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:29,162
So in my eyes, I think...

221
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:33,963
What happened
here gave her greatjoy...

222
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:39,539
And so at this time, even if they didn't
think at all of their comrades...

223
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:43,581
...I thought it was perfectly all right.

224
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:48,280
Old Lady Bamboo Curls snatched
Rimone and skipped town!

225
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:52,053
Do something about that please!

226
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:58,657
