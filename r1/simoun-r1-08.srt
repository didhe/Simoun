1
00:00:00,669 --> 00:00:09,509
The countless flowers,
enveloped in light...

2
00:00:09,739 --> 00:00:19,739
...gaze at tomorrow
with unwavering eyes.

3
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:39,199
Everyone wishes for me to be pure...

4
00:00:39,499 --> 00:00:46,599
...but what can I bring
with me to the frayed skies?

5
00:00:46,709 --> 00:00:53,779
What I've made my own
by breaking off flowers in bloom...

6
00:00:54,089 --> 00:00:59,389
All such sinful things...

7
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:06,859
Why did I stop making
promises with the future?

8
00:01:06,969 --> 00:01:14,099
Because even if I try
to run far from all the pain...

9
00:01:14,209 --> 00:01:20,839
...a cold wind rustles
my hair... Don't you see?

10
00:01:20,949 --> 00:01:28,009
Where can I ever find the answer?

11
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:34,619
I am Anubituf,
the captain of the Arcus Prima...

12
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:39,629
...one of the largest airships
in Simulacrum Kyuukoku's fleet.

13
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:45,529
Three air squadrons, Simoun chors,
are stationed on the Arcus Prima.

14
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:50,069
Chor Tempest,
Chor Caput, and Chor Rubor.

15
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:56,239
But Chor Tempest, once prided for
defense and flawless Ri Majons...

16
00:01:56,349 --> 00:02:01,309
...has lost its high standing and is now
being relegated to reserve status.

17
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:06,319
And now, as we escort
the Plumbum highland delegation...

18
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:10,919
...to international waters, where
a peace conference is scheduled...

19
00:02:11,029 --> 00:02:16,469
...tensions in Chor Tempest over its
new members have sparked a brawl.

20
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:23,979
Chor Tempest has been ordered to
disband as soon as we return to port.

21
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:29,039
For those with reasons for wanting
to continue flying the Simouns...

22
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,939
...it is a bitter sentence.

23
00:02:31,049 --> 00:02:34,349
Either way, when it's time
to journey to the Spring...

24
00:02:34,449 --> 00:02:36,979
...one can no longer fly a Simoun.

25
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:41,919
And now the peace
conference is about to begin.

26
00:02:43,529 --> 00:02:49,489
Prayer

27
00:02:50,369 --> 00:02:54,929
We understand that your priestesses
are all fluent in Kyuukoku's language.

28
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:58,999
But for translating purposes,
wouldn't just one suffice?

29
00:03:03,179 --> 00:03:05,169
We are not mere interpreters.

30
00:03:05,279 --> 00:03:08,339
We also watch over
this important conference.

31
00:03:08,449 --> 00:03:11,579
And several are needed
for certain ceremonies.

32
00:03:11,689 --> 00:03:13,349
That's fine.

33
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:18,159
We should have some of Tempus
Spatium's priestesses attend as well.

34
00:03:18,259 --> 00:03:20,249
I think that's a good idea.

35
00:03:22,999 --> 00:03:25,489
They are not merely priestesses...

36
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,829
...but soldiers too, no?

37
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:39,409
How long will you snivel?

38
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,249
Thanks to you, we've been disbanded.

39
00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:44,249
We should be crying.

40
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:49,289
But at least now we can
finally stop flying Simouns.

41
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:57,489
Mamina, what have
you been doing since then?

42
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,969
You lived with your mother after
your father passed away, correct?

43
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:03,869
Tell me about it.

44
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:09,139
I've got to keep flying Simouns.
I have to remain a sibylla...

45
00:04:12,149 --> 00:04:14,379
That's just like Aer.

46
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,789
You want to go on
being a sibylla too, right?

47
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:20,879
No way.

48
00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:25,119
Why? As long as you're a sibylla,
you don't have to go to the Spring.

49
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:26,929
That's the problem.

50
00:04:27,029 --> 00:04:30,559
We all want to go to the Spring,
but since becoming sibyllae...

51
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:35,229
...we have to take part in this war now
and are unable to go to the Spring.

52
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:39,599
It's not like it's forbidden.
Just quit being a sibylla, right?

53
00:04:39,709 --> 00:04:42,439
After being finally
chosen after such toil?

54
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:47,509
I do have my pride as a priestess.
Avoiding the front line isn't an option.

55
00:04:47,619 --> 00:04:49,449
We all have our reasons...

56
00:04:49,549 --> 00:04:54,179
...but I've never seen anyone who
wanted to avoid going to the Spring.

57
00:04:54,489 --> 00:04:57,189
Oh? If you want to see, be my guest.

58
00:04:57,299 --> 00:04:58,259
Here.

59
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,099
What are you doing?

60
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:04,799
It's obvious.

61
00:05:04,899 --> 00:05:09,969
This ballroom is where Chor Tempest
socializes. It's always been that way.

62
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:12,699
People like the captain
never decided that.

63
00:05:12,809 --> 00:05:15,609
But it's always been
that way, remember?

64
00:05:15,709 --> 00:05:18,339
You guys never used to come here.

65
00:05:19,249 --> 00:05:22,349
You're on standby and might
scramble at any time, right?

66
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:23,819
Take it easy.

67
00:05:36,999 --> 00:05:39,399
Oh, jeez, I can't stand this.

68
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:43,069
Big Sister, why don't
you come to my room?

69
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:47,409
Hey, everybody! Big news!

70
00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:49,909
Big news! Big news!

71
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:54,409
She always seems to be having fun.

72
00:05:55,419 --> 00:05:58,579
It's been decided that just two
of the highland priestesses...

73
00:05:58,689 --> 00:06:01,959
...will be allowed
to attend the peace conference.

74
00:06:02,059 --> 00:06:07,159
Meaning that this priestess here,
Anglas, will not be allowed to attend.

75
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:11,659
She'll stay with Chor Tempest
until the conference is over.

76
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:14,869
Because we're fellow priestesses?

77
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:18,229
We can leave it at that.

78
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:22,469
I'll be patrolling the conference site.
I hope everything's clear.

79
00:06:22,579 --> 00:06:25,379
Make sure you don't offend our guest.

80
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:32,179
The only thing is we don't
speak the same language...

81
00:06:34,429 --> 00:06:37,689
I am not fluent, but I can speak a little.

82
00:06:41,329 --> 00:06:46,289
I've heard many highland priestesses
are from the border near Kyuukoku.

83
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:51,469
Right, speaking of which, that area's
tribes travel between the countries.

84
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:57,279
They say our god was once
the same deity that you worship here.

85
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:00,369
That's why, um...

86
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:03,789
You feel an affinity with us.

87
00:07:08,289 --> 00:07:10,059
The little one is Rimone.

88
00:07:10,559 --> 00:07:14,499
The two on the right are Alty and Kaim.
They're sisters, you know.

89
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:15,829
That's Morinas.

90
00:07:15,929 --> 00:07:19,959
Rimone, Alty, Kaim, Morinas.

91
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:22,059
And there...

92
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:26,439
Starting from the right, Paraietta,
Dominüra, and Roatreamon.

93
00:07:26,539 --> 00:07:30,879
Paraietta, Dominüra, Roatreamon.

94
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:33,349
What a lovely name.

95
00:07:34,649 --> 00:07:36,589
It's a very noble name.

96
00:07:37,119 --> 00:07:41,079
From a venerable family that's borne
generations of Simoun sibyllae.

97
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:45,389
And the girl who just spoke up
is Mamina. Next to her is...

98
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:46,689
I'm Yun.

99
00:07:47,829 --> 00:07:51,459
And I wish for
a speedy end to the war.

100
00:07:51,569 --> 00:07:55,559
I'm glad to know there will soon
be peace between our countries.

101
00:07:55,669 --> 00:07:57,639
Mamina and Yun.

102
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:01,069
That's what I wish for too.

103
00:08:01,209 --> 00:08:02,979
My name's Floe.

104
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:04,239
Floe.

105
00:08:04,349 --> 00:08:06,339
Let's see... Who else?

106
00:08:06,849 --> 00:08:09,319
The girl in the very back is Aer.

107
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,479
The only one missing is Neviril.
And that's everyone.

108
00:08:17,559 --> 00:08:19,529
Pleased to meet you.

109
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,499
Now that introductions are done...

110
00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:24,259
Hey, hold on!

111
00:08:29,539 --> 00:08:32,409
You're the only one
she didn't call by name.

112
00:08:32,509 --> 00:08:35,779
Yeah, she said
everyone's name but mine.

113
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:38,539
Does she have
to say every single name?

114
00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:39,979
How tedious.

115
00:08:40,079 --> 00:08:42,019
I know it is, but...

116
00:08:42,119 --> 00:08:45,249
Say, what do you think about this?

117
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:47,549
We're priestesses.

118
00:08:47,659 --> 00:08:51,319
But we turned the Simouns
into weapons of war.

119
00:08:51,429 --> 00:08:53,019
To do that...

120
00:08:53,129 --> 00:08:57,589
In the eyes of normal priestesses
like you, it's peculiar, isn't it?

121
00:09:01,069 --> 00:09:03,729
It is very cold in the highlands.

122
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,039
We're blessed by
a compassionate god, but even so...

123
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:12,169
Every year, there is a cold snap,
resulting in many deaths.

124
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:14,709
I am a priestess...

125
00:09:14,819 --> 00:09:20,779
...so I pray that those who have
perished may find bliss in God's arms.

126
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:23,659
I know what you mean.

127
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:26,389
When we first started as sibyllae...

128
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:31,299
...I thought we would fly Simouns
in divine ceremonies like that.

129
00:09:31,669 --> 00:09:36,069
You're right. We should be flying
the Simouns in order to pray...

130
00:09:36,169 --> 00:09:38,669
What a carefree attitude.

131
00:09:39,309 --> 00:09:44,299
You take becoming a sibylla
for granted, so you can say that.

132
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:47,439
What do you mean by that, Mamina?

133
00:09:48,349 --> 00:09:54,089
If it hadn't been for this war,
I never could have become a sibylla.

134
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:03,259
There were only a handful
of young girls in my village.

135
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:07,899
So it wasn't hard to serve the great
temple as a priestess in training.

136
00:10:08,239 --> 00:10:09,399
But...

137
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:16,409
U-Um...

138
00:10:17,119 --> 00:10:21,139
When I become a sibylla,
will you fly with me as my pair?

139
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:24,079
You? A sibylla?

140
00:10:24,189 --> 00:10:29,149
Sibyllae are selected by Tempus
Spatium. People of humble birth...

141
00:10:32,429 --> 00:10:35,059
And then that day came.

142
00:10:37,669 --> 00:10:39,829
Plumbum highland's death squad...

143
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:43,569
...crossed the border and
took up position in our village.

144
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:49,909
Their goal was of course to steal
the Simouns from the great temple.

145
00:10:50,009 --> 00:10:51,949
There was no time to lose.

146
00:10:52,049 --> 00:10:56,509
We had to launch the Simouns
and repulse them from the skies.

147
00:10:56,819 --> 00:11:01,319
The sibyllae said, "We are
priestesses. We can't go into battle."

148
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:06,589
The dux turned to
the trainees for volunteers.

149
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:11,829
Such a thing...

150
00:11:12,199 --> 00:11:14,999
Tempus Spatium will never allow it.

151
00:11:15,109 --> 00:11:18,339
One such as you
could never fly a Simoun...

152
00:11:54,549 --> 00:11:56,569
And so I became a sibylla.

153
00:11:56,679 --> 00:12:00,549
But only because I was
accomplished in battle.

154
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:04,149
Otherwise, being of low birth
and having no connections...

155
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:07,549
...I would've been stripped
of my post right away.

156
00:12:08,259 --> 00:12:11,849
If only I could pair up
with Neviril... With Sibylla Aurea...

157
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:15,729
Then no one could ever
treat me like an upstart again.

158
00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:20,199
And I could prove there's
no better sibylla in the world.

159
00:12:20,299 --> 00:12:22,499
But now...

160
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,969
It's over.

161
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:26,509
That's enough.

162
00:12:27,049 --> 00:12:30,779
That's not something one
should tell another land's priestess.

163
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:32,249
I don't mind.

164
00:12:32,349 --> 00:12:35,979
But anyway, I'm sure keeping
me company is very dull.

165
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,389
Please go about your day freely.

166
00:12:38,489 --> 00:12:43,259
Oh? You can take a tour of the ship
as long as it's not a restricted area.

167
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:45,289
I'd like that!

168
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:48,759
Then as my guide... Do you mind?

169
00:12:50,099 --> 00:12:53,589
It's Aer, all right? Call me by name.

170
00:13:39,479 --> 00:13:43,049
Is it all right to go into
another god's chapel?

171
00:13:43,149 --> 00:13:46,989
As I mentioned earlier,
the recent theory is that our god...

172
00:13:47,089 --> 00:13:53,359
...was once the same as your
own deity, Tempus Spatium.

173
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:58,729
Then does that mean your country
used to be a colony of ours?

174
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:00,599
Oh, no.

175
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:02,699
Before Tempus Spatium...

176
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:06,869
...there may have been
an even more ancient religion.

177
00:14:12,549 --> 00:14:14,179
Aren't you going to...

178
00:14:14,289 --> 00:14:16,249
I'm not a priestess.

179
00:14:17,219 --> 00:14:19,089
How could that be?

180
00:14:19,189 --> 00:14:23,919
Oh, forget her. She's just here since
she doesn't want to go to the Spring.

181
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,929
Praying to gods is trivial.

182
00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:30,629
What do you mean? You haven't
picked a gender yet either, right?

183
00:14:31,069 --> 00:14:32,699
Well, no, but...

184
00:14:36,569 --> 00:14:41,239
If you're not sure, forcing an answer
would be even more ridiculous.

185
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:59,259
A Plumbum dictionary?

186
00:14:59,359 --> 00:15:00,389
Go away.

187
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:03,489
What's the problem?
You and I are a pair.

188
00:15:03,599 --> 00:15:04,729
No.

189
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:21,009
What's that?

190
00:15:21,389 --> 00:15:23,109
I'll check on the conference.

191
00:15:23,219 --> 00:15:24,419
Me too.

192
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:28,919
Hey, what do you think...

193
00:15:40,099 --> 00:15:41,829
Those fireworks were a signal.

194
00:15:41,939 --> 00:15:43,769
First, where's the priestess?

195
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:46,469
Aer-sama, Sibylla Aurea is...

196
00:16:05,929 --> 00:16:07,689
She's got my sister!

197
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:09,429
Why would she...

198
00:16:13,569 --> 00:16:15,039
Neviril, what's this?

199
00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:18,169
It's as it seems.
This is how they do things.

200
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:20,969
The conference was
a diversion for their infiltration.

201
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:22,879
To take a Simoun?

202
00:16:22,979 --> 00:16:25,469
You can't fly that Simoun, you know!

203
00:16:26,149 --> 00:16:30,309
She's a priestess, right? If there
were two, it might be possible to fly it.

204
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:35,019
If she does, what are those people
in the conference planning to do?

205
00:16:35,129 --> 00:16:38,889
Waporif, block the maintenance
hangar off from the conference room.

206
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:41,429
Don't let two highland
priestesses rendezvous!

207
00:16:41,529 --> 00:16:45,129
Didn't you hear her? Move it!
We're blocking all access!

208
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:50,169
Do you really think
you're going to pull this off?

209
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,109
Give it up.

210
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:00,149
Big Sister!

211
00:17:00,849 --> 00:17:02,249
Alty! Watch out!

212
00:17:02,349 --> 00:17:05,449
Grab her!
Don't let her touch that Simoun!

213
00:17:18,639 --> 00:17:20,229
Don't tell me she's...

214
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,529
What?

215
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:34,379
If you're unsure of yourself,
you'll never find an answer.

216
00:17:35,049 --> 00:17:36,109
Run, Floe.

217
00:17:36,949 --> 00:17:37,759
Neviril!

218
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:39,119
Neviril!
Right. Bombs!

219
00:17:39,219 --> 00:17:40,779
Run, everybody!

220
00:17:41,159 --> 00:17:42,719
She's got bombs!

221
00:17:45,159 --> 00:17:47,859
Aer!

222
00:18:18,859 --> 00:18:20,589
What are you...

223
00:18:26,199 --> 00:18:27,639
But why?

224
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:42,109
Nearly all the Simouns
here were destroyed.

225
00:18:42,219 --> 00:18:44,519
We have to see
if the ones spared work...

226
00:18:44,619 --> 00:18:45,879
Which can fly?

227
00:18:45,989 --> 00:18:48,459
Only the Simouns on the left side.

228
00:18:49,889 --> 00:18:52,689
Only Chor Tempest's
Simouns, you mean.

229
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:58,099
Are you all right, Aer?

230
00:18:58,199 --> 00:19:01,929
That girl called out "Aer"...
At the very end...

231
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:03,169
What?

232
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:06,739
But why? Why my name...

233
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:09,749
Because it's not
a person's name to her.

234
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:13,209
The word "aer" in her own language...

235
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:16,719
...means "the highest love of all."

236
00:19:18,019 --> 00:19:22,759
"Aer" means "the love of god"
in the Plumbum language.

237
00:19:27,529 --> 00:19:28,559
Why?

238
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:33,739
Just what is it about this "love of god"?

239
00:19:34,569 --> 00:19:38,239
How can it make
someone do a thing like that?

240
00:20:20,849 --> 00:20:24,509
Sibylla Aurea,
please fly with me as your pair.

241
00:20:24,619 --> 00:20:28,579
I just heard that Chor Tempest's
Simouns are the only ones intact.

242
00:20:28,689 --> 00:20:31,679
You're completely sure
about this, aren't you?

243
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:34,289
We don't have time not to be.

244
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,419
Aer, what will you do?

245
00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:42,699
I don't know. I just don't know.

246
00:20:43,669 --> 00:20:45,699
I'm not sure anymore...

247
00:20:51,819 --> 00:20:55,619
Aer, you came here
to fly a Simoun, didn't you?

248
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,849
I just don't want to go to the Spring.

249
00:21:01,629 --> 00:21:03,959
But is that a good thing?

250
00:21:05,659 --> 00:21:09,119
I don't even have
love of god or anything...

251
00:21:11,469 --> 00:21:13,939
You needn't come up with an answer.

252
00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:30,679
I'm unsure too.

253
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:33,159
About being a priestess.

254
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:35,559
About going into battle.

255
00:21:36,389 --> 00:21:39,359
Whether those are
the right things to do.

256
00:21:39,459 --> 00:21:43,729
You and I are completely
different in every respect.

257
00:21:44,399 --> 00:21:47,229
But we're alike in just one way.

258
00:21:48,439 --> 00:21:50,169
Stand up, Aer.

259
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:52,739
I am your pair.

260
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:10,889
One second is enough. Right the ship.
We're launching the Simouns.

261
00:22:10,999 --> 00:22:13,089
Rubor and Caput were destroyed?

262
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:15,259
Chor Tempest will be going out.

263
00:22:41,089 --> 00:22:47,719
It is played by my wounds...
the song of prayer.

264
00:22:47,829 --> 00:22:51,959
Let it ring out over
the grieving universe.

265
00:22:52,069 --> 00:22:58,999
Can we change tomorrow?
Don't be afraid.

266
00:22:59,109 --> 00:23:06,849
I want to let you know
how my heart's overflowing.

267
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:19,519
"I want to get closer to you."
"I want to feel your pulse."

268
00:23:19,629 --> 00:23:24,689
I was too defiant,
and I took the long way around.

269
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:28,699
The blue moon is swaying silently.

270
00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:32,709
My true heart's desire is you.

271
00:23:32,809 --> 00:23:38,579
I can't reach you.
My tears of pain trickle down.

272
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:44,119
Soar away into the sky, song of prayer.

273
00:23:44,219 --> 00:23:47,549
Carrying my love that came too late.

274
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:53,219
What can I do to change tomorrow?

275
00:23:53,329 --> 00:23:59,699
Just hold on to "now" the way it is...

276
00:24:05,009 --> 00:24:06,209
To Be Continued

277
00:24:06,209 --> 00:24:06,509
To Be Continued
We will soon be performing...

278
00:24:06,509 --> 00:24:08,479
We will soon be performing...

279
00:24:08,579 --> 00:24:13,039
...our last Ri Majon as members of
Chor Tempest at the great temple.

280
00:24:15,219 --> 00:24:15,349
Next time on Simoun...

281
00:24:15,349 --> 00:24:17,549
The Hearing
Next time on Simoun...

282
00:24:17,549 --> 00:24:19,819
The Hearing
The Hearing.
