1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:09,730
The countless flowers,
enveloped in light...

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:20,340
...gaze at tomorrow
with unwavering eyes.

3
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:38,990
Everyone wishes for me to be pure...

4
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:46,700
...but what can I bring
with me to the frayed skies?

5
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:53,870
What I've made my own
by breaking off flowers in bloom...

6
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:59,450
All such sinful things...

7
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:06,930
Why did I stop making
promises with the future?

8
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:14,200
Because even if I try
to run far from all the pain...

9
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:20,940
...a cold wind rustles
my hair... Don't you see?

10
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:28,450
Where can I ever find the answer?

11
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,780
Get a move on!

12
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,190
You say it's a Simoun from Arcus Niger?

13
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:39,330
Military Councilor!

14
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:41,660
Military Councilor!
What's the meaning of this!

15
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,290
Arcus Niger...

16
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,490
...was shot down.

17
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,290
What?

18
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,840
Seven o'clock! Five ancient
Simouns approaching fast!

19
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,640
What in the world?

20
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:07,680
Sortie

21
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,260
Four o'clock! Multiple aircraft sighted!

22
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,760
Hurry, confirm that!

23
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,960
They appear to be
Shoukoku cruise missiles!

24
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,760
Vura, take one of the similes.

25
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:18,760
Right.

26
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,270
Which way should we head?

27
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,100
She's right. They say the
enemy Simouns are here too!

28
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:26,570
We're going to destroy the
missiles headed toward the city!

29
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,540
What about the Highland Simouns?

30
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,200
Arcus Prima and the Messis...

31
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,370
...will have to meet the
attack without our protection.

32
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,010
Para-sama...

33
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,220
Kaim...

34
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:38,110
We have to give it our best shot.
That's all we can do now!

35
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,010
Right!

36
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,060
Falcon Ri Majon!

37
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,560
Falcon Ri Majon!

38
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,300
Falcon Ri Majon!

39
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,440
Nine o'clock! More aircraft approaching!

40
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,810
Tell me what they are and how many!

41
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,540
Shoukoku cruise missiles!
Twenty of them!

42
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:18,420
Roatreamon! Three o'clock,
more missiles headed our way!

43
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,520
Right.

44
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,750
What's wrong?

45
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,230
Oh, it's nothing...

46
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:28,400
Whether it's a Ri Majon to
honor the souls of the dead...

47
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,460
...or a Ri Majon to repulse the enemy...

48
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:34,940
...a Ri Majon is still a Ri Majon.

49
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,440
That's what I used to believe.

50
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,170
Morinas...

51
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,080
Para-sama!

52
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:10,940
Come on!

53
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,720
Para-sama, the shrapnel
is falling over the town!

54
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,050
There's just too many of them!

55
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,530
Para-sama, look!

56
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,310
But now I know that's not true at all.

57
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,340
Yes, they're both Ri Majons, but they're
for a completely different purpose!

58
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:46,470
Hold on tight!

59
00:04:58,690 --> 00:04:59,790
Morinas!

60
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:01,430
Morinas!

61
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,890
Are you two all right?

62
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:06,320
Morinas is hurt...

63
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:11,560
Don't worry. It's nothing. What about
you, Roatreamon? Are you all right?

64
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,230
Yes, I'm fine.

65
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,870
Paraietta, what about the enemy Simouns?

66
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,640
The thing is... I can't be sure, but...

67
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,280
They seem to have flown off.

68
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,820
What's that?

69
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,610
They're turning around and flying away.

70
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,090
Are you absolutely sure?

71
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:31,020
The Plumbum enemy Simouns
are about to leave our sights!

72
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,390
Why?

73
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,830
Why didn't the enemy Simouns attack us?

74
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,870
I know. But if they had attacked us,
they might have gotten us.

75
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:51,740
Guragief?

76
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:52,470
Yes?

77
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,880
Your quarters, please.

78
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:55,880
What?

79
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,720
Well?

80
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,730
What's going on?

81
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,000
Military Councilor?

82
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,700
Anubituf, what's going on?

83
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:24,300
The simile transporting Sibylla
Mamina's body never returned.

84
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,410
No...

85
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,810
I'm certain it was
intercepted by the enemy.

86
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:33,110
Needless to say, this happened
within the Kyuukoku borders.

87
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,290
Meaning we've already lost
control of our own airspace.

88
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,090
Then...

89
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,150
...what about Sibylla Mamina's body?

90
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:46,260
Guragief, that hardly matters anymore!

91
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,170
Can't you see we're in a state of...

92
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:49,400
Can't you see we're in a state of...
So it's no concern of ours...

93
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:52,910
...what happens to Sibylla Mamina's
body. Is that what you're saying, sir?

94
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,240
Guragief...

95
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:57,180
You are not to inform the
sibyllae of this matter.

96
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:00,180
Anubituf!

97
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,580
I don't believe this! Even you...

98
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:05,210
The fact that the enemy Simouns
showed up in battle today...

99
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,180
...was a taunt to let us know
they can attack us at any time.

100
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:14,330
And that's exactly
what they're capable of.

101
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,610
No way...

102
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:34,510
I can't believe such a thing
could've happened while we were gone.

103
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,880
There must be something
we can do to help.

104
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:39,920
Right!

105
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,830
Come in!

106
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:55,330
How are you holding up, Sibylla Morinas?

107
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:56,940
Waporif!

108
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:00,940
Waporif, are you good
at wrapping bandages?

109
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,680
I had no idea Roatreamon
was so bad at this.

110
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,410
Please, allow me, Sibylla Roatreamon.

111
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,740
You see, the doctor was busy, so...

112
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:16,450
He's gone to the great temple,
tending to the injured civilians.

113
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:17,680
I see.

114
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:20,890
Well, I'm leaving her
in your hands then.

115
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:21,960
Fine.

116
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,260
Morinas...

117
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:30,260
We still have a lot of
things to do, don't we?

118
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,460
Sure.

119
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:37,010
Still, I like the Ri Majons
that we offer to Tempus Spatium.

120
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,010
Yeah, so do I.

121
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:42,510
And you know what? I bet
everyone else feels the same way!

122
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,950
Right!

123
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,590
How bad is the damage to the Simoun?

124
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:01,160
Looks like we'll only
have to replace the canopy.

125
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:05,930
We just finished repairing Sibylla
Aurea's Simoun, and now this...

126
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,530
I'm sorry.

127
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,830
Was there no other way?

128
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:12,740
No, there really wasn't.

129
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:16,040
I want you to take
better care of yourself.

130
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,680
All right, I will.

131
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,280
Promise me.

132
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:22,720
I promise.

133
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,440
Let me ask you one more time.

134
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:51,510
There is no longer any way to engage
the Shoukoku-highlands alliance...

135
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,780
Is that what you're saying?

136
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:55,580
You were the one...

137
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:59,620
...who took away three of the Simoun
sibyllae at such a critical time.

138
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,750
Let's be clear about
who's responsible for this!

139
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,590
I believe the situation is well
past the point of assigning blame.

140
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:09,500
We really should return to
the purpose of this meeting.

141
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:14,170
One hour ago, the
Shoukoku-highlands alliance...

142
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,580
...offered Simulacrum
Kyuukoku a cease-fire.

143
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:21,870
Now that they have a
clear advantage over us...

144
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:24,540
...they're actually suing for peace?

145
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,480
Don't tell me you've
already forgotten how...

146
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:28,550
...the highlands negotiated
peace the last time.

147
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:32,860
But it is our people's desire to bring
an end to this war as soon as possible!

148
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:35,730
Can't you see that their
offer is nothing but a sham?

149
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:36,400
Not again...

150
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,770
Not again...
This wouldn't have happened...

151
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:37,800
Not again...

152
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,570
Not again...
...if you'd tried to negotiate peacefully.

153
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:38,600
...if you'd tried to negotiate peacefully.

154
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,090
I've had enough of your petty grudges!
...if you'd tried to negotiate peacefully.

155
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,730
How dare you!

156
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,070
I...

157
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,270
I'm not fit for this...

158
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,770
That's not true, Aer.

159
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:56,370
No matter what you may think
yourself, you are a Simoun sibylla.

160
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,280
All I know is war.

161
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,190
I don't know anything about praying.

162
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,950
Amuria...

163
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,790
She was a warrior too.

164
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:13,460
Even so, her prayers brought
solace to many people.

165
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,360
Everyone flocked to
Amuria to be blessed.

166
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,440
The priestesses are going
to protect us, right?

167
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:26,570
The priestesses are going to
strike down all the bad guys!

168
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:29,910
That's right. Just be
patient a little while longer.

169
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,180
Okay!

170
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,900
I'm so sorry. I didn't
think you'd be here.

171
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:55,470
That's all right.

172
00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:00,510
Neviril and Aer are
blessing the people outside.

173
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,070
Yes, I know.

174
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,550
Who ever thought we'd
see Aer doing that?

175
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,420
Really!

176
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:09,250
You're the one we'd expect to
take the initiative... Oh...

177
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,820
Yes, that's true.

178
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,770
Mamina...

179
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,970
I think she should be by your side, Yun.

180
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,210
Why is that?

181
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,310
I can't really explain why...

182
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:37,380
...but I want you to
hold on to this for me.

183
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,420
So...

184
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:57,730
Yun, will you look after
Mamina for me from now on?

185
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,470
Fine.

186
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:15,040
I never thought you'd
hide anything from me.

187
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,750
Neither did I.

188
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,860
What is it that you want from me?

189
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,890
I just don't know anymore!

190
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:28,730
What do I want from you?

191
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,280
Emergency! Guys, it's an emergency!

192
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:43,680
Neviril! Aer!

193
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,690
Neviril!

194
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,720
Neviril! We just heard that they're
asking for another peace treaty.

195
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,060
Yes, Floe just told us.

196
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,960
But is that information true?

197
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,220
Yes, Sibylla Neviril.

198
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,790
Guragief...

199
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,890
Did the information come from you then?

200
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,130
Only a handful of
people are aware of this.

201
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:08,860
I took it upon myself to inform you all.

202
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,300
I see.

203
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:13,680
So is the war really
going to end this time?

204
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,150
I don't know about that.

205
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:18,880
Remember, Anglas was
supposed to be visiting...

206
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:21,550
...Kyuukoku as an interpreter
for the peace conference.

207
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:24,050
I know, but maybe this time around...

208
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,430
Yes.

209
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:30,030
It's possible that this time we'll be
able to release you sibyllae from battle.

210
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,090
Whatever happens, there's
nothing we can do about it.

211
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,000
That's right.

212
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:41,830
We can only do what we
have the power to do.

213
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:48,570
Guragief, I'd like to
discuss something with you...

214
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,450
Sibylla Aurea!

215
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:52,250
Sibylla Aurea!
Yes?

216
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:55,220
Paraietta said the same thing just now!

217
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,750
Did she?

218
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:01,720
First off, to protect
ourselves from being invaded...

219
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,260
...from the mountains,
let us go out on patrol.

220
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,270
I understand it's a
state of emergency, but...

221
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,770
Just look at the size
of the Arcus Prima.

222
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:18,740
Yes.

223
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,820
I find it hard to believe that Arcus
Niger, a ship of the same dimensions...

224
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,610
...was actually shot down.

225
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,020
Yes, indeed.

226
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:30,890
Just as hard to believe as
seeing you at odds with Guragief!

227
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,290
So you noticed?

228
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,590
I can't imagine the
depth of your feelings...

229
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,660
...for each other that
neither of you can concede.

230
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,760
Guragief is...

231
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:44,260
...too single-minded.

232
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,640
That's for sure!

233
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:49,700
It's a shame that he
decided to become a man!

234
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,910
Anubituf...

235
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,500
Try to make peace with
Guragief as soon as you can.

236
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,820
You might not have a lot
of time left with him.

237
00:15:58,890 --> 00:15:59,880
Right.

238
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,250
I have to get back to the bridge.

239
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,550
Para-sama!

240
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,090
Hurry, Kaim.

241
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,460
But why are they attacking us again?

242
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:16,060
They're going to keep at it
until they bend us to their will!

243
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,200
Let's go.

244
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,100
Para-sama!

245
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,040
Cast off the moorings!

246
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,840
Drop anchor!

247
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,150
Ascend at top speed! Hurry!

248
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,450
Ascending at top speed.

249
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,850
What's going on?

250
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:47,300
Seven o'clock! Five ancient
Simouns approaching!

251
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,970
Eleven o'clock, Shoukoku
midrange aircraft approaching!

252
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,600
Prepare the Simouns for takeoff!

253
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,740
Yes, sir!

254
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,220
Where are the priestesses
from Chor Tempest?

255
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,850
They're not here yet, sir.

256
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,890
What?

257
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:09,290
What are you waiting for, Anubituf?

258
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,190
Order Chor Tempest to go into battle!

259
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:13,590
Captain?

260
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:14,890
Captain?
Pay no attention to him.

261
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,250
Anubituf!

262
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,500
Communications officer...

263
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:26,840
Send word for the sibyllae to
stand by on the flight deck.

264
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,900
I'm going to convey my orders in person.

265
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:29,600
Yes, sir!

266
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,640
Guragief, I'm leaving
you in charge for now.

267
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,950
The Arcus Prima will launch
the second wave of our attack.

268
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,920
You'll be directing
the Arcus Prima then.

269
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:39,980
Understood!

270
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,980
I'll be in command until
the captain returns.

271
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:44,660
Yes, sir!

272
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:48,020
What are you doing?
Get up there already!

273
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,990
Our orders are to stand
by on the flight deck.

274
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,500
What the!

275
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:56,960
Damn that Anubituf! What's he thinking?

276
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:57,970
Standing by at a time like this!

277
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:59,600
Standing by at a time like this!
That old guy is so obnoxious!

278
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,740
Sorry to keep you waiting, sibyllae.

279
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:08,470
Hold on, you...

280
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,310
Surprised?

281
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:15,990
It may be hard to believe, but I too
was once a sibylla just like all of you.

282
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,880
You're going to fly a Simile, then?

283
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:23,490
Yes. We're going to have to meet the
enemy attack with only five Simouns.

284
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:28,430
I'm going up in a Simile and will
give you direct orders in the sky.

285
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,090
Please follow those orders.

286
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:31,690
Yes, sir! Understood!

287
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,240
Sibylla Morinas...

288
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:37,930
How is your wound?

289
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,410
I was given impeccable
treatment, sir. Everything is fine!

290
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,110
Get that Simile ready to go. Now!

291
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:45,740
Yes, sir!

292
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,330
Sibyllae...

293
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:10,410
The time has come for
us to take you out...

294
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:12,710
...of this war that you've
been fighting for us.

295
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:17,080
But only because we have failed...

296
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,320
We thank you, Captain Anubituf.

297
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:23,420
No matter what happens, we
shall never forget your words.

298
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:27,590
Yeah, no need to worry!
We've already made up our minds!

299
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,550
We're just going to
give it our best shot...

300
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,320
What we have the power to do!

301
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:39,360
We're hopelessly outnumbered.

302
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:41,410
We're going to draw them
in as close as we can...

303
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,670
...then make a sudden
dive and strike them hard!

304
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:49,040
This first attack will
decide the course of battle!

305
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,110
Let's go!

306
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,070
Follow me!

307
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,350
Foreign

308
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,880
Foreign

309
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,130
All batteries, fire at will!

310
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,670
Foreign

311
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,050
They're escaping!

312
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,520
That'll show you, losers!

313
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:06,820
Right?

314
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,030
Hey...

315
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,820
How do you like that, jerks?

316
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,500
Both of you, watch your language!

317
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:16,700
You heard us?

318
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:21,230
No, but we were just saying that
you two were probably talking vulgar!

319
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,710
Thanks a lot!

320
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,970
Good work, everyone.

321
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,010
Hey, what's going on?

322
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,450
Yes, tell us!

323
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,580
I'll bet it's just Floe making
another one of her absurd comments.

324
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,310
Yeah, that's probably
it, huh, Para-sama?

325
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,520
That's insulting!

326
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,690
I never said anything like that!

327
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:41,960
I never said anything like that!
Is Chor Tempest always like this?

328
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,520
Pretty much.

329
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:54,870
The Captain's Simile, approaching!

330
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,280
Everybody, hats off!

331
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:20,730
Despite Chor Tempest's efforts...

332
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:25,200
...the center determined that
the war was now a lost cause.

333
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:28,000
And several days later...

334
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:33,540
...accepted the peace treaty offered
by the Plumbum highlands and Shoukoku.

335
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:47,850
It is played by my wounds...
the song of prayer.

336
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:52,090
Let it ring out over
the grieving universe.

337
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:59,160
Can we change tomorrow?
Don't be afraid.

338
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:06,840
I want to let you know
how my heart's overflowing.

339
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:19,650
I want to get closer to you.
I want to feel your pulse.

340
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,820
I was too defiant,
and I took the long way around.

341
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:28,800
The blue moon is swaying silently.

342
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:32,840
My true heart's desire is you.

343
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:38,710
I can't reach you.
My tears of pain trickle down.

344
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:44,250
Soar away into the sky, song of prayer.

345
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:47,680
Carrying my love that came too late.

346
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:53,350
What can I do to change tomorrow?

347
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:59,660
Just hold on to "now" the way it is...

348
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:06,400
To Be Continued

349
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:10,740
As alliance soldiers take
control of the Arcus Prima...

350
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:13,080
...Chor Tempest is disbanded.

351
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:15,480
Next time on Simoun...

352
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:16,450
Eternal Maidens

353
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:17,950
Eternal Maidens
Eternal Maidens.

354
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:19,980
Eternal Maidens
