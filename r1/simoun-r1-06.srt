1
00:00:00,497 --> 00:00:09,467
The countless flowers,
enveloped in light...

2
00:00:09,577 --> 00:00:20,177
...gaze at tomorrow
with unwavering eyes.

3
00:00:32,127 --> 00:00:39,057
Everyone wishes for me to be pure...

4
00:00:39,367 --> 00:00:46,467
...but what can I bring
with me to the frayed skies?

5
00:00:46,577 --> 00:00:53,647
What I've made my own
by breaking off flowers in bloom...

6
00:00:53,917 --> 00:00:59,217
All such sinful things...

7
00:00:59,327 --> 00:01:06,697
Why did I stop making
promises with the future?

8
00:01:06,797 --> 00:01:13,997
Because even if I try
to run far from all the pain...

9
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:20,707
...a cold wind rustles
my hair... Don't you see?

10
00:01:20,807 --> 00:01:27,977
Where can I ever find the answer?

11
00:02:06,457 --> 00:02:09,487
Neviril, more... More powerful, Neviril.

12
00:02:13,897 --> 00:02:18,497
Neviril, don't look! You can't
kill them if you see their eyes!

13
00:02:19,567 --> 00:02:21,227
Neviril!

14
00:02:39,687 --> 00:02:41,057
Amuria!

15
00:02:45,697 --> 00:02:47,257
Amuria!

16
00:03:09,187 --> 00:03:15,147
Wounds and Pain

17
00:03:22,037 --> 00:03:25,487
Hey, Alty. Chase those birds. Please?

18
00:03:25,607 --> 00:03:28,337
We're on duty right now, you know.

19
00:03:28,737 --> 00:03:32,367
So what? We won't
run into the enemy here!

20
00:03:33,077 --> 00:03:35,567
You'll just miss out
if you're so wound up.

21
00:03:35,677 --> 00:03:38,777
Well, I guess you're
right about that, but...

22
00:03:42,157 --> 00:03:45,817
They've been flying by us awhile.
I wonder where they're headed.

23
00:03:45,927 --> 00:03:49,987
They can't fly forever. They'll rest
their wings when they're tired.

24
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:53,617
They've got to eat
when they get hungry, right?

25
00:03:57,267 --> 00:03:59,997
What are they doing? We're on duty.

26
00:04:08,847 --> 00:04:11,907
Things seem pretty
mellow these days.

27
00:04:12,417 --> 00:04:13,717
I guess so.

28
00:04:13,817 --> 00:04:18,017
We finally returned to duty too.
We seem to have lost our edge.

29
00:04:18,117 --> 00:04:21,787
And Aer never
volunteers to fly anymore...

30
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:25,997
Para-sama...

31
00:04:26,827 --> 00:04:29,997
How's Sibylla Aurea
doing these days?

32
00:04:31,907 --> 00:04:33,667
The same, huh?

33
00:04:33,767 --> 00:04:35,167
Are you concerned?

34
00:04:35,277 --> 00:04:36,707
Not really.

35
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,177
But it's like we've been left hanging.

36
00:04:40,277 --> 00:04:43,737
It seems like the others are
starting to accept her being gone.

37
00:04:45,387 --> 00:04:50,717
This means we can never go back
to the old Chor Tempest, doesn't it?

38
00:04:52,857 --> 00:04:54,347
Para-sama...

39
00:04:54,457 --> 00:04:57,727
I'm keeping
an eye on you, Para-sama.

40
00:04:59,727 --> 00:05:01,217
Just kidding.

41
00:05:07,837 --> 00:05:10,737
Rimone,
we're heading for the pool now.

42
00:05:10,837 --> 00:05:11,607
I'm not.

43
00:05:11,607 --> 00:05:12,577
I'm not.
No.

44
00:05:12,647 --> 00:05:14,447
You're still young, so your endurance...

45
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:16,507
You're still young, so your endurance...
I'm hungry!

46
00:05:16,617 --> 00:05:19,377
Rimone! Hey, hold on!

47
00:05:20,217 --> 00:05:23,657
Um, why don't we all take lunch first?

48
00:05:36,397 --> 00:05:39,337
Is something the matter,
Sibylla Paraietta?

49
00:05:39,437 --> 00:05:41,957
This is Sibylla Aurea's...

50
00:05:42,807 --> 00:05:44,867
I'm still repairing it.

51
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:48,237
We had to rebuild
some things from scratch...

52
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:52,307
...so I had a hard time
getting all the components.

53
00:05:55,457 --> 00:05:58,047
Your wounds haven't healed yet.

54
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:02,417
You haven't flown in a while.

55
00:06:21,207 --> 00:06:23,707
Neviril! Hey, Neviril!

56
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:27,777
You've been cooped up long enough.
Get back on duty already!

57
00:06:29,617 --> 00:06:34,387
Chor Tempest just gets lame missions
because you won't come back!

58
00:06:34,887 --> 00:06:37,117
I can't take much more!

59
00:06:37,227 --> 00:06:40,527
This is no place for us to be flying!

60
00:06:43,667 --> 00:06:45,967
Are you listening, Neviril?

61
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:48,337
Neviril!

62
00:06:55,477 --> 00:06:57,777
You stubborn mule!

63
00:07:13,297 --> 00:07:16,097
Really, what a childish thing...

64
00:07:26,547 --> 00:07:29,307
I guess I'm in no position to talk.

65
00:07:39,887 --> 00:07:44,657
I'm sorry. There was
no need for you to do that.

66
00:07:44,757 --> 00:07:47,057
No, I really didn't mind.

67
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:50,467
Really, what are
we going to do with Aer?

68
00:07:50,567 --> 00:07:54,027
She's troubling you, right?
Shall I make her stop?

69
00:07:56,677 --> 00:08:00,637
Of course, I'm sure
it's not going to be pretty...

70
00:08:07,917 --> 00:08:12,257
Neviril... Don't you think
it's time you made things clear?

71
00:08:13,127 --> 00:08:14,027
Made what clear?

72
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:17,517
Made what clear?
Either way, we can't go on like this.

73
00:08:17,627 --> 00:08:20,287
Won't you come back to the chor?

74
00:08:22,697 --> 00:08:27,767
If you decide to go to the Spring,
then this time I'll accompany you.

75
00:08:27,867 --> 00:08:28,967
I'm sorry.

76
00:08:32,107 --> 00:08:34,407
I'm still unsure myself.

77
00:08:34,507 --> 00:08:37,917
About going to the Spring...
and about flying Simouns.

78
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,777
I can't decide yet.

79
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:41,147
But...

80
00:08:41,247 --> 00:08:43,777
I'm fully aware that it's wrong.

81
00:08:45,117 --> 00:08:50,957
But I feel that no matter which choice
I make, it would be a betrayal...

82
00:08:51,057 --> 00:08:52,397
Betrayal?

83
00:08:54,197 --> 00:08:56,227
That's the feeling I get.

84
00:09:05,107 --> 00:09:06,907
You mean Amuria.

85
00:09:09,417 --> 00:09:14,937
Neviril... I've spent my life by your
side ever since we were children.

86
00:09:15,047 --> 00:09:17,987
I've always walked
the same path as you.

87
00:09:18,087 --> 00:09:20,217
That's why I can say this.

88
00:09:21,997 --> 00:09:24,357
Your place is in a Simoun.

89
00:09:26,297 --> 00:09:30,927
Even if that means
you'll have to betray Amuria...

90
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:33,467
Don't talk to me as if you know!

91
00:09:35,067 --> 00:09:38,267
It's not as simple as that.

92
00:09:47,147 --> 00:09:48,477
Leave me.

93
00:11:02,357 --> 00:11:03,797
I see...

94
00:11:04,827 --> 00:11:06,857
She's overwhelmed, huh?

95
00:11:07,827 --> 00:11:11,397
And you've been so worried
about her, Para-sama...

96
00:11:22,077 --> 00:11:26,607
But I don't see why she doesn't
try to understand how you feel.

97
00:11:26,717 --> 00:11:29,377
I don't like the way Neviril's acting.

98
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:32,047
Don't talk like you know.

99
00:11:32,157 --> 00:11:33,347
I do know.

100
00:11:33,457 --> 00:11:36,287
In other words,
she's just being childish, right?

101
00:11:39,167 --> 00:11:40,327
She's not.

102
00:11:40,427 --> 00:11:42,297
Then what's up with her?

103
00:11:51,707 --> 00:11:56,007
Sure, losing Amuria
was a big blow to her...

104
00:11:56,117 --> 00:11:59,447
...but she's not
the only one who misses her.

105
00:11:59,547 --> 00:12:04,177
Keeping herself holed up is really
causing trouble for the rest of us.

106
00:12:04,617 --> 00:12:05,917
Kaim.

107
00:12:08,957 --> 00:12:12,357
I'm sorry. I was out of line.

108
00:12:13,027 --> 00:12:14,467
Para-sama.

109
00:12:15,467 --> 00:12:17,327
What happened to your hands?

110
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:19,927
Oh, I was cleaning something...

111
00:12:20,037 --> 00:12:23,027
You can't just leave them like that.

112
00:12:23,507 --> 00:12:25,937
I know! Could you wait a little?

113
00:12:26,477 --> 00:12:28,137
S-Sure.

114
00:12:33,547 --> 00:12:36,717
I see... My nails are starting to shine.

115
00:12:36,817 --> 00:12:40,777
Aren't they? You've got such beautiful
fingers, so take care of them...

116
00:12:40,887 --> 00:12:43,947
...or Tempus Spatium will scold you.

117
00:12:47,997 --> 00:12:49,467
You enjoy this.

118
00:12:49,567 --> 00:12:52,867
I'm getting to take care of you, aren't I?

119
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,007
And touch you.

120
00:12:56,277 --> 00:12:58,237
Just kidding.

121
00:13:02,917 --> 00:13:05,647
I think she's just lonely.

122
00:13:07,017 --> 00:13:09,177
We probably all are.

123
00:13:09,287 --> 00:13:11,947
All of us on this ship...

124
00:13:13,187 --> 00:13:16,787
Lonely, probably... That's what I think.

125
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:26,297
I'm sorry.

126
00:13:28,877 --> 00:13:30,967
Hey, Para-sama.

127
00:13:31,837 --> 00:13:34,207
Are you lonely too, Para-sama?

128
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:38,237
Do I look that bad to you?

129
00:13:38,647 --> 00:13:40,707
That's not what I meant.

130
00:13:41,947 --> 00:13:44,747
I'm asking because I'm lonely too.

131
00:13:48,157 --> 00:13:49,677
Para-sama...

132
00:13:56,897 --> 00:13:59,527
It's hot in here, isn't it?

133
00:13:59,637 --> 00:14:02,967
Then why don't
we go where it's cooler?

134
00:14:10,147 --> 00:14:13,117
No change in the princess yet?

135
00:14:13,217 --> 00:14:15,477
Unfortunately, no.

136
00:14:16,417 --> 00:14:18,787
It reminds me of the past.

137
00:14:18,887 --> 00:14:20,977
Like a certain someone, no?

138
00:14:23,257 --> 00:14:28,217
It's not uncommon for a sibylla
to question her flight duties.

139
00:14:29,967 --> 00:14:33,957
I was the one who offered
you a helping hand then, right?

140
00:14:34,067 --> 00:14:36,037
I haven't forgotten.

141
00:14:37,307 --> 00:14:38,607
Vroom!

142
00:14:38,707 --> 00:14:39,767
Pow-pow-pow-pow!

143
00:14:39,877 --> 00:14:42,007
Vroom!

144
00:14:42,247 --> 00:14:44,177
Vroom! Blam!

145
00:14:44,277 --> 00:14:47,247
Pow-pow-pow-pow!
I see some more coming at us!

146
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:49,887
Blam! Pow-pow-pow-pow!

147
00:14:50,287 --> 00:14:54,347
I'm not scared of that lame attack!
Let's see you hit us if you can!

148
00:14:54,457 --> 00:14:56,987
Vroom! Pow-pow-pow-pow!

149
00:14:57,327 --> 00:15:00,227
Hey! Para-sama!
Enemy to your right!

150
00:15:00,327 --> 00:15:03,727
Strafe them with
the machine gun! Hurry!

151
00:15:03,837 --> 00:15:04,957
All right!

152
00:15:05,067 --> 00:15:06,157
Pow-pow-pow!

153
00:15:06,267 --> 00:15:08,367
Wow, Para-sama! 100 of 100!

154
00:15:08,467 --> 00:15:10,367
Pow-pow-pow! Pow-pow-pow-pow!

155
00:15:10,937 --> 00:15:14,607
Another group of enemies
beyond the clouds! Ray Ri Majon!

156
00:15:21,947 --> 00:15:22,937
Kaim?

157
00:15:23,787 --> 00:15:26,117
Hey, Para-sama...

158
00:15:27,657 --> 00:15:29,917
Let's do a Ri Majon.

159
00:15:46,207 --> 00:15:49,197
Strange... We always do that, but...

160
00:16:05,797 --> 00:16:08,487
Uh-oh! We've got to turn it off!

161
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:13,227
Kaim!

162
00:16:29,817 --> 00:16:31,447
Big Sister...

163
00:16:31,917 --> 00:16:33,887
Big Sister Kaim...

164
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:07,647
I was always by her side.

165
00:17:08,357 --> 00:17:11,387
I'd decided to stay by her side forever.

166
00:17:12,497 --> 00:17:17,157
And before I knew it, being near
her had become a natural thing.

167
00:17:28,177 --> 00:17:30,147
How arrogant of me...

168
00:17:31,147 --> 00:17:35,707
Thinking I was the only
one she could ever lean on...

169
00:17:36,217 --> 00:17:39,707
I thought that it was obvious...

170
00:17:48,397 --> 00:17:53,737
In that moment,
I wasn't the only one who felt pain.

171
00:17:57,507 --> 00:17:59,537
Is that the reason why?

172
00:18:08,847 --> 00:18:10,047
Para-sama?

173
00:18:10,157 --> 00:18:11,217
Let's not do this.

174
00:18:11,217 --> 00:18:12,707
Let's not do this.
Why?

175
00:18:12,827 --> 00:18:15,257
Because you're still a child, Kaim.

176
00:18:15,357 --> 00:18:17,187
What? I'm not a child!

177
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:18,257
You are.

178
00:18:18,257 --> 00:18:19,487
You are.
I'm not!

179
00:18:20,227 --> 00:18:22,287
We're all children.

180
00:18:22,397 --> 00:18:27,197
That's why we try to heal our wounds
but end up creating new wounds.

181
00:18:30,937 --> 00:18:32,267
I'm going now.

182
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:34,207
Good night, Kaim.

183
00:18:40,217 --> 00:18:41,577
Why?

184
00:18:43,257 --> 00:18:46,707
Jeez, why can't you
see how I feel, Para-sama?

185
00:18:59,267 --> 00:19:00,327
Neviril!

186
00:19:00,407 --> 00:19:03,857
Neviril! Just listen to me
for a second, will you?

187
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:05,567
Neviril!

188
00:19:05,907 --> 00:19:07,337
Neviril!

189
00:19:09,747 --> 00:19:11,077
I swear...

190
00:19:11,647 --> 00:19:16,087
Now that it's come to this, I'll drag
you out if it's the last thing I do.

191
00:19:17,287 --> 00:19:18,587
Paraietta.

192
00:19:18,687 --> 00:19:21,087
Aer, I'd like to talk.

193
00:19:26,997 --> 00:19:30,657
It doesn't look like we're
about to do any talking.

194
00:19:30,997 --> 00:19:33,027
Didn't you know?

195
00:19:33,137 --> 00:19:36,367
The maju pool can
be used for this too.

196
00:19:38,307 --> 00:19:43,107
So how did I end up
having to face you like this?

197
00:19:48,147 --> 00:19:49,377
Let's go!

198
00:20:01,097 --> 00:20:05,627
The reason Neviril refuses to decide
isn't just because of Amuria.

199
00:20:07,307 --> 00:20:08,707
I see now.

200
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:12,537
It was also out of
respect for my feelings.

201
00:20:14,307 --> 00:20:18,767
Neviril, I'm sorry.
I didn't know anything.

202
00:20:20,417 --> 00:20:23,317
But just let me say this.

203
00:20:23,417 --> 00:20:27,477
I don't feel as though
you've betrayed me!

204
00:20:32,227 --> 00:20:35,057
And I appreciate how
considerate you're being.

205
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:37,797
That's why...

206
00:20:39,237 --> 00:20:40,427
That's why...

207
00:20:43,377 --> 00:20:47,137
That's why I'll put my hopes on
one who can surpass Amuria!

208
00:20:57,187 --> 00:20:58,657
I've got you!

209
00:21:01,487 --> 00:21:02,477
What?

210
00:21:02,587 --> 00:21:03,717
Over here!

211
00:21:10,537 --> 00:21:11,697
You're open!

212
00:21:11,797 --> 00:21:12,767
What?

213
00:21:21,047 --> 00:21:23,007
Is that good enough?

214
00:21:37,397 --> 00:21:40,017
Aer! Go and pair up with Neviril!

215
00:21:43,767 --> 00:21:46,097
You don't have to tell me that.

216
00:21:53,277 --> 00:21:54,607
Hey, Floe...

217
00:21:54,707 --> 00:21:56,337
What is it?

218
00:21:56,447 --> 00:21:58,777
So what happens next?

219
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:00,037
What?

220
00:22:00,147 --> 00:22:04,817
The birds who rest their wings...
You said they couldn't fly forever.

221
00:22:04,917 --> 00:22:07,407
They'll fly again of course.

222
00:22:07,557 --> 00:22:08,547
They will?

223
00:22:08,657 --> 00:22:13,287
That's right. Because birds
were born to fly in the sky.

224
00:22:13,967 --> 00:22:16,087
To fly in the sky...

225
00:22:20,537 --> 00:22:23,267
If she's resting her wings, it's all right.

226
00:22:26,677 --> 00:22:30,577
But a bird who can't fly
because she's been wounded...

227
00:22:30,677 --> 00:22:33,167
...has no hope of survival.

228
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:47,657
It is played by my wounds...
the song of prayer.

229
00:22:47,767 --> 00:22:51,897
Let it ring out over
the grieving universe.

230
00:22:51,997 --> 00:22:58,967
Can we change tomorrow?
Don't be afraid.

231
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:06,747
I want to let you know
how my heart's overflowing.

232
00:23:15,457 --> 00:23:19,447
"I want to get closer to you."
"I want to feel your pulse."

233
00:23:19,567 --> 00:23:24,627
I was too defiant,
and I took the long way around.

234
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:28,637
The blue moon is swaying silently.

235
00:23:28,737 --> 00:23:32,607
My true heart's desire is you.

236
00:23:32,707 --> 00:23:38,507
I can't reach you.
My tears of pain trickle down.

237
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:44,057
Soar away into the sky, song of prayer.

238
00:23:44,157 --> 00:23:47,517
Carrying my love that came too late.

239
00:23:47,627 --> 00:23:53,157
What can I do to change tomorrow?

240
00:23:53,267 --> 00:23:59,357
Just hold on to "now" the way it is...

241
00:24:05,037 --> 00:24:05,677
To Be Continued

242
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:06,447
To Be Continued
In order to sign a peace treaty...

243
00:24:06,447 --> 00:24:07,637
In order to sign a peace treaty...

244
00:24:07,747 --> 00:24:13,077
...delegations from the highlands and
the Arcus Prima are about to meet.

245
00:24:14,517 --> 00:24:15,287
Next time on Simoun...

246
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,457
Over International Waters
Next time on Simoun...

247
00:24:16,457 --> 00:24:19,647
Over International Waters
Over International Waters.
