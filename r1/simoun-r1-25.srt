1
00:00:00,903 --> 00:00:09,903
The countless flowers,
enveloped in light...

2
00:00:10,013 --> 00:00:20,513
...gaze at tomorrow
with unwavering eyes.

3
00:00:32,503 --> 00:00:39,163
Everyone wishes for me to be pure...

4
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:46,873
...but what can I bring
with me to the frayed skies?

5
00:00:46,983 --> 00:00:54,043
What I've made my own
by breaking off flowers in bloom...

6
00:00:54,353 --> 00:00:59,623
All such sinful things...

7
00:00:59,723 --> 00:01:07,103
Why did I stop making
promises with the future?

8
00:01:07,203 --> 00:01:14,373
Because even if I try
to run far from all the pain...

9
00:01:14,473 --> 00:01:21,103
...a cold wind rustles
my hair... Don't you see?

10
00:01:21,213 --> 00:01:28,623
Where can I ever find the answer?

11
00:01:43,573 --> 00:01:44,563
Yun!

12
00:01:45,173 --> 00:01:51,133
Pair

13
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:54,643
But that's Yun.

14
00:01:55,153 --> 00:01:55,913
Yun!

15
00:01:55,983 --> 00:01:57,113
No way...

16
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:58,153
Where's Onasia?

17
00:01:58,683 --> 00:02:00,653
What's become of Onasia, Yun?

18
00:02:01,193 --> 00:02:03,153
And why are you...

19
00:02:04,093 --> 00:02:05,613
I think I know why.

20
00:02:05,963 --> 00:02:09,153
You decided this is where
you want to be, right, Yun?

21
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,663
Roatreamon, what do you mean?

22
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,893
Yun has made her choice.

23
00:02:15,603 --> 00:02:17,693
She's chosen her own path.

24
00:02:24,213 --> 00:02:27,303
I am here now.

25
00:02:28,613 --> 00:02:31,603
That's right. Yun's right there.

26
00:02:32,423 --> 00:02:33,183
Let's go.

27
00:02:38,523 --> 00:02:40,553
Maybe...

28
00:02:40,823 --> 00:02:44,593
...I should've come here before
with all my friends from Rubor.

29
00:02:49,533 --> 00:02:50,933
Let's go in together.

30
00:02:52,473 --> 00:02:53,443
Yes!

31
00:02:54,513 --> 00:02:58,773
Paraietta, you've been
through a lot, haven't you?

32
00:03:00,283 --> 00:03:02,803
I think we all have.

33
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:06,773
Morinas, you don't have
any regrets, do you?

34
00:03:08,893 --> 00:03:12,483
Well, I did want to pray to
the skies in an ancient Simoun.

35
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:15,783
I mean I wanted to operate one!

36
00:03:16,533 --> 00:03:21,523
I always wanted to sit in the captain's
chair on the Arcus Prima, just once!

37
00:03:24,973 --> 00:03:25,763
Come on!

38
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:28,263
Knock it off, both of you!

39
00:03:28,573 --> 00:03:29,633
But...

40
00:03:30,013 --> 00:03:31,273
I...

41
00:03:31,683 --> 00:03:32,663
I feel...

42
00:03:33,243 --> 00:03:36,773
...as if I don't know
anything about any of you.

43
00:03:38,983 --> 00:03:39,783
Right.

44
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:44,423
We don't really know
anything about each other.

45
00:03:45,263 --> 00:03:50,563
But we must all fall if
we ever want to understand.

46
00:03:51,233 --> 00:03:53,063
We must fall.

47
00:03:54,303 --> 00:03:56,063
Uttering screams along the way...

48
00:03:56,133 --> 00:03:58,293
Even as we're racked by fear...

49
00:03:58,673 --> 00:04:00,403
With our hearts in our mouths...

50
00:04:01,313 --> 00:04:04,303
We must hold on to ourselves and
keep falling and falling endlessly.

51
00:04:05,213 --> 00:04:06,803
And as you continue to fall...

52
00:04:07,743 --> 00:04:09,913
You reach out and cling to something...

53
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:13,813
...because you're so afraid,
and you try to hang on somehow.

54
00:04:14,523 --> 00:04:17,983
But we have to let go
eventually, don't we?

55
00:04:18,723 --> 00:04:22,823
Somewhere at the bottom of that
abyss, I promise you I'll be waiting.

56
00:04:24,803 --> 00:04:25,823
Big Sister...

57
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:08,653
The priestesses of Chor Tempest...

58
00:06:09,173 --> 00:06:12,293
Actually, I suppose we shouldn't
be calling them that anymore.

59
00:06:12,843 --> 00:06:15,203
But yes, they should be returning soon.

60
00:06:15,813 --> 00:06:17,773
I'm looking forward to finding out...

61
00:06:17,843 --> 00:06:21,003
...what decision each of the
priestesses of Chor Tempest has made.

62
00:06:21,213 --> 00:06:23,483
Yes, I'm looking forward to that too.

63
00:06:24,553 --> 00:06:26,113
And what about those two?

64
00:06:27,283 --> 00:06:30,623
I think they're going to be
our last responsibility here.

65
00:06:31,093 --> 00:06:31,923
Yes.

66
00:06:51,613 --> 00:06:52,673
At the Spring...

67
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:54,913
Yun was supporting us, wasn't she?

68
00:06:54,983 --> 00:06:55,883
Yes.

69
00:06:56,053 --> 00:06:57,883
It almost felt like being in a cradle.

70
00:06:58,683 --> 00:07:01,673
All of our emotions,
all at the same time!

71
00:07:11,633 --> 00:07:12,933
Listen, we're...

72
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:05,973
I am here now.

73
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:18,493
What's the matter, Aer?

74
00:08:25,803 --> 00:08:26,963
Aer?

75
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:34,883
Tell me!

76
00:08:34,983 --> 00:08:35,913
What?

77
00:08:36,353 --> 00:08:39,323
Tell me why my heart hurts so much!

78
00:08:39,523 --> 00:08:41,483
You know the answer, don't you?

79
00:08:42,253 --> 00:08:42,983
Yes.

80
00:08:43,453 --> 00:08:44,513
Why?

81
00:08:44,863 --> 00:08:46,983
Why is it that my heart
is hurting so much?

82
00:08:48,663 --> 00:08:51,223
Because you're in love.

83
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:56,133
This is love?

84
00:08:57,073 --> 00:09:00,503
Yes. That's what love is, Aer.

85
00:09:03,313 --> 00:09:05,003
I love you!

86
00:09:06,143 --> 00:09:07,973
And I love you.

87
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:33,263
Amuria... She was a
strong person, wasn't she?

88
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:35,033
Yes, she was.

89
00:09:35,373 --> 00:09:37,533
She was a strong person.

90
00:09:50,753 --> 00:09:52,453
Secretly meeting with
a highland priestess...

91
00:09:52,523 --> 00:09:55,323
...and before Tempus Spatium too?

92
00:09:55,793 --> 00:09:57,893
That can't be the
action of a sane person.

93
00:09:58,163 --> 00:09:59,463
I believe...

94
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:06,233
...this will be my last task for
the Chor Tempest Simoun sibyllae.

95
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:11,243
I hope that Tempus
Spatium will be forgiving.

96
00:10:12,183 --> 00:10:17,743
I can't forget what Sibylla
Neviril said during the hearing.

97
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:25,583
I am not looking to blame
anyone for this war we're waging.

98
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,823
No matter how tragic and
painful our lives may be now...

99
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:29,923
...I believe that it was
all meant to happen this way.

100
00:10:30,133 --> 00:10:33,033
Whether or not that is the
will of Tempus Spatium...

101
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:36,293
...it makes no difference to me now.

102
00:10:37,073 --> 00:10:41,003
I no longer even care whether
it's God's will anymore...

103
00:10:41,373 --> 00:10:44,743
However, I do have one
question for you all.

104
00:10:45,313 --> 00:10:47,143
Despite all this...

105
00:10:47,243 --> 00:10:49,873
...can I still call
myself a Simoun sibylla?

106
00:10:58,863 --> 00:10:59,983
Guragief...

107
00:11:05,133 --> 00:11:08,623
I have a feeling you never
stopped being a sibylla, even now.

108
00:11:15,813 --> 00:11:16,603
Yes?

109
00:11:18,813 --> 00:11:20,503
Oh, Paraietta!

110
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,143
I'm back.

111
00:11:22,953 --> 00:11:25,043
We're all waiting on
the observation deck.

112
00:11:25,253 --> 00:11:26,113
Okay.

113
00:11:28,853 --> 00:11:30,153
Paraietta!

114
00:11:31,093 --> 00:11:33,423
I'm back, Neviril.

115
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,583
I think I'll go on ahead!

116
00:11:38,263 --> 00:11:40,023
You guys can join us later.

117
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:42,663
Would you do that, Aer?

118
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:44,393
See you!

119
00:11:45,243 --> 00:11:46,833
I'll see you later too, Paraietta.

120
00:11:47,203 --> 00:11:48,073
Right.

121
00:11:50,373 --> 00:11:52,863
Will you dance with me?

122
00:11:53,943 --> 00:11:54,813
Yes.

123
00:12:17,073 --> 00:12:18,633
The soldiers are watching.

124
00:12:19,043 --> 00:12:20,233
I don't mind.

125
00:12:21,103 --> 00:12:22,733
Does it bother you, Neviril?

126
00:12:23,713 --> 00:12:25,733
No, not really.

127
00:12:26,983 --> 00:12:31,243
There are still two priestesses
who have not yet entered the Spring.

128
00:12:31,653 --> 00:12:35,483
Yes, Sibylla Neviril and Sibylla Aer.

129
00:12:38,323 --> 00:12:41,983
When do they plan to
make their pilgrimage?

130
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:44,823
Welcome back, everyone!

131
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:51,563
How was the city?

132
00:12:52,043 --> 00:12:54,773
Everyone seemed really happy.

133
00:12:55,073 --> 00:12:57,303
Yes, so many smiling faces!

134
00:12:57,773 --> 00:12:59,803
Were you bored, Aer?

135
00:13:01,713 --> 00:13:05,113
Well, I did some maju by
myself and then had some tea.

136
00:13:05,883 --> 00:13:08,373
You guys haven't really
changed much. Uh...

137
00:13:09,253 --> 00:13:11,243
I chose to become a woman.

138
00:13:11,353 --> 00:13:12,383
I chose to become a woman too.

139
00:13:12,763 --> 00:13:14,123
And I...

140
00:13:15,633 --> 00:13:16,463
Male?

141
00:13:16,863 --> 00:13:17,693
Right!

142
00:13:18,903 --> 00:13:20,293
I chose to become male also.

143
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:21,723
I see...

144
00:13:26,943 --> 00:13:30,603
They'll go as soon as
they feel ready to do so.

145
00:13:30,673 --> 00:13:32,003
We cannot wait.

146
00:13:32,343 --> 00:13:36,513
This is the most crucial
condition in our peace treaty.

147
00:13:36,853 --> 00:13:43,453
Yes, but it's not as if a time limit has
been set for that condition to be met.

148
00:13:44,453 --> 00:13:45,513
Foreign

149
00:13:48,563 --> 00:13:49,683
We cannot wait.

150
00:13:53,663 --> 00:13:55,963
The reason I didn't choose Aer...

151
00:13:56,633 --> 00:14:00,473
...wasn't because I didn't
want to betray you once again.

152
00:14:01,443 --> 00:14:04,973
It was simply an excuse to
protect myself from getting hurt.

153
00:14:06,343 --> 00:14:08,873
I just wanted to be a good girl.

154
00:14:09,853 --> 00:14:10,843
Can you imagine?

155
00:14:25,303 --> 00:14:26,963
Wanting to be a good
girl all the time...

156
00:14:27,663 --> 00:14:28,863
How childish is that?

157
00:14:29,733 --> 00:14:33,263
I was sure that both Amuria and
Aer had chosen me as their pair...

158
00:14:33,643 --> 00:14:35,333
...just as a tool...

159
00:14:35,543 --> 00:14:39,673
...to complete the Emerald Ri Majon.

160
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:41,873
But I was wrong.

161
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:46,073
I was the one who was drawn
to their single-mindedness!

162
00:14:47,183 --> 00:14:51,023
I came to realize that they're
both far more pure in spirit than I.

163
00:14:53,023 --> 00:14:57,083
Neither of them are
afraid of getting hurt.

164
00:14:57,693 --> 00:15:00,253
Yes, exactly, Paraietta.

165
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:05,363
I've made up my mind to be true
to what I'm feeling right now.

166
00:15:06,403 --> 00:15:09,603
Once you stop trying to subject
others to your own feelings...

167
00:15:10,173 --> 00:15:13,573
...you start to feel as if you can
plant your feet on a bigger stage.

168
00:15:14,243 --> 00:15:16,643
I'm not going to wait and be
consumed by the waiting anymore.

169
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:22,123
And I'm going to stop blaming
everything on the one I love.

170
00:15:23,053 --> 00:15:26,113
Because I want to learn what
it's like to be truly loved.

171
00:15:29,493 --> 00:15:31,823
Paraietta! Did you...

172
00:15:32,203 --> 00:15:32,993
Yes.

173
00:15:35,433 --> 00:15:37,703
I chose to stay female.

174
00:15:38,643 --> 00:15:42,073
We will arrange for them to be
escorted to the Spring by nightfall.

175
00:15:42,773 --> 00:15:44,873
Our soldiers will accompany them.

176
00:15:59,993 --> 00:16:02,053
I chose to become a woman.

177
00:16:03,233 --> 00:16:04,023
Right.

178
00:16:05,633 --> 00:16:07,763
Me too. I chose to become a woman too.

179
00:16:08,403 --> 00:16:09,803
I see!

180
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,283
Welcome home.

181
00:16:24,153 --> 00:16:25,273
I'm back.

182
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:31,343
What do you want?

183
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:32,493
Neviril!

184
00:16:33,563 --> 00:16:34,783
Let go of me!

185
00:16:35,633 --> 00:16:36,283
Aer!

186
00:16:36,993 --> 00:16:38,053
Neviril!

187
00:16:38,293 --> 00:16:39,283
Neviril!

188
00:16:42,803 --> 00:16:46,293
Sibylla Aurea, please wait here for now.

189
00:16:53,143 --> 00:16:54,403
Let go of me, you morons!

190
00:16:55,453 --> 00:16:56,413
Aer...

191
00:16:56,753 --> 00:16:57,743
Let go!

192
00:17:00,783 --> 00:17:01,913
Aer...

193
00:17:15,403 --> 00:17:16,393
Aer...

194
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:05,103
No! They can't make Neviril
and Aer go to the Spring.

195
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,243
Right!

196
00:18:06,623 --> 00:18:08,023
Those two are our...

197
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:11,223
That's right. They're carrying
our present on their shoulders!

198
00:18:11,653 --> 00:18:15,893
Paraietta, is this really part of the
peace treaty that Simulacrum agreed to?

199
00:18:15,993 --> 00:18:18,023
Yeah, can they really do this?

200
00:18:19,633 --> 00:18:21,063
Neviril and Aer...

201
00:18:21,763 --> 00:18:24,033
...will only go to that
Spring over my dead body!

202
00:18:26,103 --> 00:18:28,873
The eternal present...

203
00:18:31,313 --> 00:18:31,863
Aer...

204
00:18:33,513 --> 00:18:35,883
I love you.

205
00:18:37,813 --> 00:18:38,873
Aer...

206
00:18:43,023 --> 00:18:45,253
I want to see you, Neviril!

207
00:18:46,423 --> 00:18:49,453
I want to touch you, Neviril!

208
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,033
Aer...

209
00:18:56,073 --> 00:18:57,003
Neviril...

210
00:19:21,993 --> 00:19:22,723
Foreign

211
00:19:22,793 --> 00:19:23,553
Foreign

212
00:19:26,133 --> 00:19:27,263
Don't do it, Alty!

213
00:19:38,273 --> 00:19:38,903
Foreign

214
00:19:51,193 --> 00:19:52,653
Now what should we do?

215
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:55,383
Captain!

216
00:19:55,933 --> 00:20:00,193
That title is no longer
appropriate for me.

217
00:20:00,963 --> 00:20:01,933
But...

218
00:20:02,803 --> 00:20:05,633
We have asked permission
to give our sibyllae...

219
00:20:05,703 --> 00:20:08,533
...a final farewell before
they go to the Spring.

220
00:20:08,873 --> 00:20:13,933
That's the most the Arcus Prima's
captain could manage to do for them.

221
00:20:47,883 --> 00:20:49,003
Foreign

222
00:20:50,683 --> 00:20:51,703
Foreign

223
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:57,553
How uncharacteristically
barbaric of you!

224
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:58,853
I suppose.

225
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:01,723
Aer...

226
00:21:02,593 --> 00:21:03,463
Right!

227
00:21:04,693 --> 00:21:05,593
Let's go.

228
00:21:12,303 --> 00:21:12,963
Thank you!

229
00:21:14,003 --> 00:21:14,973
Please hurry!

230
00:21:23,653 --> 00:21:25,483
Aer! Neviril!

231
00:21:26,553 --> 00:21:27,713
Paraietta!

232
00:21:28,523 --> 00:21:30,453
Floe, Alty.

233
00:21:32,023 --> 00:21:33,323
Don't cry, Floe.

234
00:21:33,423 --> 00:21:34,413
But...

235
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:35,453
I said don't cry!

236
00:21:36,193 --> 00:21:37,023
Morinas.

237
00:21:38,233 --> 00:21:39,253
We're counting on you!

238
00:21:40,203 --> 00:21:41,253
Roatreamon...

239
00:21:42,063 --> 00:21:44,333
I suppose this is
goodbye, Sibylla Aurea.

240
00:21:44,773 --> 00:21:46,503
Farewell, both of you.

241
00:21:47,543 --> 00:21:49,273
I know you two can do it!

242
00:21:50,243 --> 00:21:52,303
Vura, Kaim.

243
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:54,013
Paraietta.

244
00:21:55,513 --> 00:21:57,983
Farewell, Aer...

245
00:21:58,713 --> 00:22:00,013
Neviril...

246
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:02,023
Farewell.

247
00:22:03,053 --> 00:22:06,023
I promise you, someday,
we'll meet again...

248
00:22:12,063 --> 00:22:13,493
Take care of yourselves.

249
00:22:13,903 --> 00:22:16,523
Farewell, eternal priestesses.

250
00:22:41,263 --> 00:22:47,893
It is played by my wounds...
the song of prayer.

251
00:22:48,003 --> 00:22:52,133
Let it ring out over
the grieving universe.

252
00:22:52,233 --> 00:22:59,203
Can we change tomorrow?
Don't be afraid.

253
00:22:59,313 --> 00:23:06,873
I want to let you know
how my heart's overflowing.

254
00:23:15,693 --> 00:23:19,683
I want to get closer to you.
I want to feel your pulse.

255
00:23:19,803 --> 00:23:24,863
I was too defiant,
and I took the long way around.

256
00:23:24,973 --> 00:23:28,843
The blue moon is swaying silently.

257
00:23:28,943 --> 00:23:32,873
My true heart's desire is you.

258
00:23:32,983 --> 00:23:38,743
I can't reach you.
My tears of pain trickle down.

259
00:23:38,853 --> 00:23:44,293
Soar away into the sky, song of prayer.

260
00:23:44,393 --> 00:23:47,723
Carrying my love that came too late.

261
00:23:47,823 --> 00:23:53,393
What can I do to change tomorrow?

262
00:23:53,503 --> 00:23:59,703
Just hold on to "now" the way it is...

263
00:24:05,113 --> 00:24:06,143
To Be Continued

264
00:24:06,213 --> 00:24:07,643
This is...

265
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:11,343
...the tale of the
sibyllae's "tomorrow."

266
00:24:13,153 --> 00:24:16,213
Next time, on the final
episode of Simoun...

267
00:24:16,523 --> 00:24:19,043
Their Portraits
Their Portraits.
