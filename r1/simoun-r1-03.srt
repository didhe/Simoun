1
00:00:00,477 --> 00:00:09,437
The countless flowers,
enveloped in light...

2
00:00:09,547 --> 00:00:19,557
...gaze at tomorrow
with unwavering eyes.

3
00:00:32,037 --> 00:00:38,777
Everyone wishes for me to be pure...

4
00:00:39,317 --> 00:00:46,417
...but what can I bring
with me to the frayed skies?

5
00:00:46,517 --> 00:00:53,587
What I've made my own
by breaking off flowers in bloom...

6
00:00:53,897 --> 00:00:59,167
All such sinful things...

7
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:06,637
Why did I stop making
promises with the future?

8
00:01:06,737 --> 00:01:13,907
Because even if I try
to run far from all the pain...

9
00:01:14,017 --> 00:01:20,617
...a cold wind rustles
my hair... Don't you see?

10
00:01:20,727 --> 00:01:27,647
Where can I ever find the answer?

11
00:01:59,097 --> 00:02:01,427
Who are you? What are you doing?

12
00:02:01,527 --> 00:02:03,087
Oh my.

13
00:02:03,197 --> 00:02:05,167
How'd you get in here?

14
00:02:07,907 --> 00:02:11,237
The Simouns really
are nothing like Similes.

15
00:02:11,337 --> 00:02:14,967
I asked who you were.
Also, those clothes...

16
00:02:15,077 --> 00:02:19,137
Sorry, Waporif!
She's one of our new recruits.

17
00:02:19,417 --> 00:02:22,317
Forgive me.
I didn't know you were a sibylla.

18
00:02:22,417 --> 00:02:26,147
Not at all.
I should be apologizing to you.

19
00:02:27,057 --> 00:02:28,357
That's Morinas.

20
00:02:28,457 --> 00:02:29,427
Yes.

21
00:02:31,897 --> 00:02:34,557
The helical motors
were discovered like this...

22
00:02:34,667 --> 00:02:39,357
...two spiral-shaped
devices always in pairs.

23
00:02:39,467 --> 00:02:42,627
And so that humans could
board and control them...

24
00:02:42,737 --> 00:02:46,227
...two cockpits and instrument
panels were added later.

25
00:02:46,337 --> 00:02:50,677
The collective term we
use for convenience is Simoun.

26
00:02:51,377 --> 00:02:52,677
Yes, that's right.

27
00:02:55,647 --> 00:02:58,417
Most likely,
what's controlling this side is...

28
00:02:58,517 --> 00:02:59,547
Most likely?

29
00:02:59,657 --> 00:03:03,177
Right. Most likely,
what's controlling this side...

30
00:03:03,287 --> 00:03:07,697
...first existed in space. Perhaps
we should call it the power of space.

31
00:03:07,797 --> 00:03:13,137
And controlling the other side is what
we might call the power of time.

32
00:03:13,237 --> 00:03:15,707
That's uncertain too?

33
00:03:15,807 --> 00:03:17,427
Yes, it is.

34
00:03:17,777 --> 00:03:21,677
Actually, we know almost
nothing about the helical motors...

35
00:03:21,777 --> 00:03:24,477
...that were excavated
from the earth's depths.

36
00:03:24,577 --> 00:03:25,747
All we know...

37
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,737
All we know...
...is how to operate them.

38
00:03:27,847 --> 00:03:33,687
We only maintain the sections
added on top of the helical motors.

39
00:03:33,787 --> 00:03:35,487
That's the story.

40
00:03:35,587 --> 00:03:36,857
I see.

41
00:03:36,957 --> 00:03:42,417
But Simile Simouns were built based
on helical-motor research, right?

42
00:03:42,967 --> 00:03:48,557
Yes, but riding them till now, you know
the Similes' capabilities best of all.

43
00:03:48,667 --> 00:03:53,237
Compared to Simouns,
Similes are just low-quality knockoffs.

44
00:03:53,337 --> 00:03:55,437
There's no comparison.

45
00:03:55,547 --> 00:04:00,917
Oh, I've heard there's no conclusive
data on the Simouns as of yet.

46
00:04:01,017 --> 00:04:03,077
It's not good to hold back.

47
00:04:03,187 --> 00:04:04,617
Hold back?

48
00:04:04,717 --> 00:04:10,817
Simouns are holy vessels offered up
to Tempus Spatium in sacred rituals.

49
00:04:10,927 --> 00:04:13,327
We regard them accordingly.

50
00:04:13,427 --> 00:04:15,227
Exactly, Morinas.

51
00:04:15,327 --> 00:04:19,667
We are here to offer
the Ri Majon to Tempus Spatium.

52
00:04:19,767 --> 00:04:22,467
As priestesses
serving Tempus Spatium.

53
00:04:22,567 --> 00:04:24,437
I'm no priestess.

54
00:04:24,907 --> 00:04:26,927
Then what are you?

55
00:04:27,037 --> 00:04:31,567
I just want to fly a Simoun.
I'm not a priestess like you.

56
00:04:31,677 --> 00:04:32,667
But...

57
00:04:32,777 --> 00:04:33,807
But?

58
00:04:37,357 --> 00:04:40,917
I'm no soldier.
You're not either, right, Paraietta?

59
00:04:43,757 --> 00:04:46,357
Oh, Paraietta. And you are?

60
00:04:46,457 --> 00:04:47,727
That's Morinas, Floe.

61
00:04:47,727 --> 00:04:49,387
That's Morinas, Floe.
Oh, right.

62
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:53,297
It's Morinas, right? Morinas...

63
00:04:53,737 --> 00:04:54,867
Good morning, Floe.

64
00:04:54,867 --> 00:04:57,767
Good morning, Floe.
Jeez, I just can't remember names.

65
00:04:57,877 --> 00:04:59,497
And besides...

66
00:05:01,207 --> 00:05:06,667
Sorry. When I first saw you, I thought
you were Waporif's new girlfriend.

67
00:05:07,847 --> 00:05:09,677
That couldn't be.

68
00:05:12,557 --> 00:05:15,387
My windshield's twisted.
I want it looked at.

69
00:05:15,487 --> 00:05:16,687
Understood!

70
00:05:17,497 --> 00:05:22,487
In the afternoon, I want more details of
the Similes and Simouns' differences.

71
00:05:22,597 --> 00:05:25,927
I'll be happy to.
Not just with the Simouns...

72
00:05:26,037 --> 00:05:30,237
If you ever need to, you can
ask us anything about this ship.

73
00:05:30,337 --> 00:05:31,537
Thank you.

74
00:05:36,577 --> 00:05:38,567
Wait. I'll go with you.

75
00:05:39,017 --> 00:05:41,707
So was that helpful, Morinas?

76
00:05:41,817 --> 00:05:45,077
I wonder if I'll learn
something new this afternoon.

77
00:05:47,627 --> 00:05:53,587
The Distant War

78
00:07:39,997 --> 00:07:41,397
Neviril...

79
00:07:41,507 --> 00:07:44,997
I am grateful that you've
returned from the Spring.

80
00:07:45,107 --> 00:07:51,107
I assume this means you've chosen
to continue on as a Simoun sibylla?

81
00:07:51,217 --> 00:07:54,307
I am still not certain. Besides...

82
00:07:54,847 --> 00:07:55,817
Besides?

83
00:07:56,817 --> 00:07:59,617
I am currently without a pair.

84
00:07:59,717 --> 00:08:02,317
Still, you have returned.

85
00:08:08,967 --> 00:08:11,727
Huh? What are you guys doing?

86
00:08:11,837 --> 00:08:13,267
You're late, Aer.

87
00:08:13,497 --> 00:08:15,997
Oh, right. Sorry, sorry.

88
00:08:17,907 --> 00:08:19,377
For what?

89
00:08:19,477 --> 00:08:23,497
Our ceremony where we gather
in the ballroom after breakfast.

90
00:08:23,607 --> 00:08:27,547
Oh, the one from when
the chor was on graveyard shift?

91
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:33,107
Anyway, would you like to have
a maju session in the pool at 3 PM?

92
00:08:35,527 --> 00:08:36,957
All of us?

93
00:08:37,057 --> 00:08:39,147
This is compulsory?

94
00:08:39,257 --> 00:08:40,227
Yes.

95
00:08:40,297 --> 00:08:42,127
At 3 PM?

96
00:08:42,227 --> 00:08:46,097
It's a good idea. Let's do it.
Since we're all a little...

97
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:51,657
We have lost three comrades.

98
00:08:51,777 --> 00:08:55,007
And afterwards,
three more left for the Spring.

99
00:08:55,547 --> 00:08:59,447
And in this emergency,
we've been relieved of night duties.

100
00:08:59,547 --> 00:09:01,577
We were the elite.

101
00:09:01,687 --> 00:09:05,117
As priestesses and as sibyllae.

102
00:09:05,217 --> 00:09:07,447
We'll regain our glory.

103
00:09:07,557 --> 00:09:09,047
I'd like to.

104
00:09:09,157 --> 00:09:13,787
I just joined, so being in
a maju with an active chor is nice.

105
00:09:13,897 --> 00:09:17,057
So you're saying to do this at 3 PM?

106
00:09:17,167 --> 00:09:20,097
Hey, what's this
about 3 PM anyway?

107
00:09:20,197 --> 00:09:21,727
That's when...

108
00:09:30,247 --> 00:09:34,267
3 PM is always Neviril's maju time.

109
00:09:39,017 --> 00:09:41,247
Sibylla Aurea Neviril.

110
00:09:41,687 --> 00:09:43,987
I am honored to meet you.

111
00:09:44,087 --> 00:09:45,057
And you're...

112
00:09:45,157 --> 00:09:50,157
I just joined the most
powerful chor... Chor Tempest.

113
00:09:50,267 --> 00:09:52,057
This is Morinas.

114
00:09:53,637 --> 00:09:57,197
I see. Please try to get
along with the others.

115
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:05,437
Aer, you team up with Morinas.

116
00:10:06,617 --> 00:10:09,447
I thought I was paired with you.

117
00:10:09,787 --> 00:10:13,187
Don't be so arrogant just
because you were once.

118
00:10:13,287 --> 00:10:17,277
First of all, no one thinks
you're capable of replacing Amuria...

119
00:10:17,387 --> 00:10:19,787
That's enough, Paraietta.

120
00:10:19,897 --> 00:10:21,417
Excuse me...

121
00:10:21,527 --> 00:10:25,257
We're all gathering at
the pool at 3 PM for a maju.

122
00:10:25,337 --> 00:10:26,297
Oh?

123
00:10:26,367 --> 00:10:30,397
That's when you always have
a maju, right, Sibylla Aurea?

124
00:10:30,507 --> 00:10:34,307
If your pair for that isn't
set yet, please choose me.

125
00:10:36,477 --> 00:10:42,007
Morinas, maju pairs are always
determined by the natural flow.

126
00:10:42,117 --> 00:10:44,177
It's not set in advance.

127
00:10:44,587 --> 00:10:49,177
I would be honored to pair up
with you, Sibylla Aurea.

128
00:10:49,287 --> 00:10:50,487
I see.

129
00:11:21,557 --> 00:11:26,717
Don't worry. That won't inflict
any real damage to the Arcus Prima.

130
00:11:26,997 --> 00:11:28,787
Y-Yes, ma'am.

131
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:32,727
You are proud candidates
for the Simoun sibylla post.

132
00:11:32,837 --> 00:11:34,957
Hold your heads higher.

133
00:11:35,067 --> 00:11:36,367
Yes, ma'am.

134
00:11:44,917 --> 00:11:47,747
That's more than usual,
don't you think?

135
00:11:47,847 --> 00:11:50,247
Maybe we should go out too...

136
00:11:50,917 --> 00:11:52,077
I want to.

137
00:11:52,187 --> 00:11:55,157
We're off combat duty right now.

138
00:12:27,587 --> 00:12:30,617
They're showering more
greetings than usual today.

139
00:12:30,727 --> 00:12:34,027
Such long-distance tactics
are just harassment...

140
00:12:34,127 --> 00:12:36,497
...but the damage isn't zero.

141
00:12:36,597 --> 00:12:40,827
I've been thinking
I'd like to take care of this.

142
00:12:40,937 --> 00:12:43,667
Is Chor Tempest finished?

143
00:12:44,167 --> 00:12:47,537
We can make up
for the losses somehow.

144
00:12:47,637 --> 00:12:48,937
Neviril?

145
00:12:49,047 --> 00:12:52,237
Yes. No matter what the remedy...

146
00:12:52,347 --> 00:12:56,677
...unless she returns,
Chor Tempest will remain scattered.

147
00:13:12,367 --> 00:13:14,027
You're early, Aer.

148
00:13:14,137 --> 00:13:15,697
You too, Alty.

149
00:13:16,537 --> 00:13:19,407
It's still a half hour till 3 PM!

150
00:13:23,277 --> 00:13:25,747
So you're here, Big Sister.

151
00:13:28,217 --> 00:13:31,587
I stopped by your room to pick you up.

152
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:35,277
If you're sisters,
why don't you fly a Simoun together?

153
00:13:35,387 --> 00:13:40,457
Being sisters has nothing to do with
the chemistry of auriga and sagitta.

154
00:13:41,127 --> 00:13:42,827
You tried?

155
00:13:42,927 --> 00:13:45,727
It's clear enough without trying.

156
00:13:45,837 --> 00:13:47,597
I shouldn't have asked.

157
00:13:55,477 --> 00:13:59,107
When this ship was a private
cruiser for observing Ri Majons...

158
00:13:59,277 --> 00:14:01,617
...it must've been a sight.

159
00:14:02,647 --> 00:14:07,817
But now it's been overhauled into
a battle mother ship for Simoun chors.

160
00:14:07,927 --> 00:14:11,117
No more gentlemen and
ladies coming and going...

161
00:14:11,227 --> 00:14:14,527
Even on this beautiful
afternoon bathed in light...

162
00:14:14,627 --> 00:14:19,857
...there's no one gathered before the
gigantic central ballroom except us.

163
00:14:19,967 --> 00:14:22,437
Just the three of us.

164
00:14:24,367 --> 00:14:29,137
I don't want it to change like this.

165
00:14:37,587 --> 00:14:40,917
It looks so fun! I can't stand it!

166
00:14:41,017 --> 00:14:43,217
Can't I fly this now?

167
00:14:43,327 --> 00:14:46,587
Simouns can't fly with
one pilot, unlike Similes.

168
00:14:46,697 --> 00:14:49,857
It needs one more
person aboard, your pair.

169
00:14:49,967 --> 00:14:51,157
That's right.

170
00:14:53,167 --> 00:14:58,507
Helical motors activate when they
receive Tempus Spatium's grace.

171
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:04,707
But if either the auriga or sagitta
is missing, it can't receive this grace.

172
00:15:04,817 --> 00:15:07,647
Both members of
the pair must be aboard.

173
00:15:07,747 --> 00:15:10,577
Hey, can I ask you something?

174
00:15:10,687 --> 00:15:13,047
Sure, what is it?

175
00:15:13,157 --> 00:15:16,287
When did you go
to the Spring, Waporif?

176
00:15:16,387 --> 00:15:19,157
Two years and
four months ago, I think?

177
00:15:19,697 --> 00:15:24,097
When I met Floe this morning, there
was a strange tension with you two.

178
00:15:24,197 --> 00:15:28,187
Oh, actually, Floe and I
used to be in love.

179
00:15:28,307 --> 00:15:30,167
I-In love?

180
00:15:30,737 --> 00:15:35,537
Inappropriate with a Simoun sibylla,
the symbol of utmost respect, right?

181
00:15:35,647 --> 00:15:37,837
No, that's not what I meant.

182
00:15:39,947 --> 00:15:42,577
But it is a little awkward now.

183
00:15:52,227 --> 00:15:55,157
You're going to the pool, aren't you?

184
00:15:55,267 --> 00:15:58,787
I told you. I'm not
going to join in the maju.

185
00:15:58,897 --> 00:16:00,697
I won't choose anyone.

186
00:16:00,797 --> 00:16:02,097
But...

187
00:16:02,507 --> 00:16:03,467
What?

188
00:16:04,067 --> 00:16:09,807
What happened to Amuria was tragic.
She was a dear comrade to us too.

189
00:16:09,907 --> 00:16:14,867
After that, I think I understand why
some of us headed for the Spring.

190
00:16:27,827 --> 00:16:31,097
Neviril, more... More powerful, Neviril.

191
00:16:31,197 --> 00:16:35,827
Neviril, don't look! You can't
kill them if you see their eyes!

192
00:17:40,697 --> 00:17:44,657
Listen, Morinas.
Any pairing is allowed in the pool.

193
00:17:44,777 --> 00:17:47,867
You don't have to think
about your battle partner.

194
00:17:47,977 --> 00:17:52,467
So it's first come, first served.
Pair up with whomever you like...

195
00:17:57,087 --> 00:17:59,717
Maybe Neviril won't
come if we're here.

196
00:18:02,127 --> 00:18:05,527
A maju without Neviril
won't be much practice.

197
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:06,717
I'm sure...

198
00:18:08,867 --> 00:18:10,457
I'm sure she'll come.

199
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:13,537
I guess that's too bad, Paraietta.

200
00:18:20,677 --> 00:18:23,667
Maybe Neviril won't come after all?

201
00:18:23,777 --> 00:18:25,767
Shall I call her?

202
00:18:25,877 --> 00:18:29,337
You shouldn't say
things you're not capable of.

203
00:18:30,217 --> 00:18:34,087
Even though she went to
the Spring, Neviril came back.

204
00:18:35,127 --> 00:18:40,427
That means she decided to remain
a Simoun sibylla of her own will, right?

205
00:18:40,527 --> 00:18:42,397
Yes, that's right.

206
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:44,357
Then she will come.

207
00:19:33,917 --> 00:19:37,477
What are you doing?
Floe, concentrate harder!

208
00:19:37,747 --> 00:19:39,147
Damn.

209
00:20:12,387 --> 00:20:16,217
With these scattered emotions,
we can't achieve a maju.

210
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:20,287
Even us, Chor Tempest...

211
00:20:22,327 --> 00:20:23,627
I don't know...

212
00:20:23,727 --> 00:20:27,757
I think you're jumping
to conclusions a little too fast.

213
00:20:41,587 --> 00:20:43,177
Neviril...

214
00:20:58,667 --> 00:21:01,967
Are you there?

215
00:21:09,177 --> 00:21:11,007
Are you?

216
00:22:09,807 --> 00:22:11,137
Hurry!

217
00:22:12,577 --> 00:22:16,437
No matter how hard
you try to protect them...

218
00:22:16,547 --> 00:22:19,137
...this is the reality.

219
00:22:23,787 --> 00:22:26,447
I'll... I'll get you out right now!

220
00:22:26,557 --> 00:22:28,517
Fire unit, hurry!

221
00:22:40,897 --> 00:22:47,537
It is played by my wounds...
the song of prayer.

222
00:22:47,637 --> 00:22:51,767
Let it ring out over
the grieving universe.

223
00:22:51,877 --> 00:22:58,807
Can we change tomorrow?
Don't be afraid.

224
00:22:58,917 --> 00:23:06,517
I want to let you know
how my heart's overflowing.

225
00:23:15,337 --> 00:23:19,327
"I want to get closer to you."
"I want to feel your pulse."

226
00:23:19,437 --> 00:23:24,507
I was too defiant,
and I took the long way around.

227
00:23:24,607 --> 00:23:28,517
The blue moon is swaying silently.

228
00:23:28,617 --> 00:23:32,487
My true heart's desire is you.

229
00:23:32,587 --> 00:23:38,387
I can't reach you.
My tears of pain trickle down.

230
00:23:38,497 --> 00:23:43,927
Soar away into the sky, song of prayer.

231
00:23:44,027 --> 00:23:47,367
Carrying my love that came too late.

232
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:53,027
What can I do to change tomorrow?

233
00:23:53,137 --> 00:23:59,277
Just hold on to "now" the way it is...

234
00:24:04,647 --> 00:24:06,277
To Be Continued

235
00:24:07,917 --> 00:24:10,977
Rimone! Get a move on! Let's go!

236
00:24:13,897 --> 00:24:15,167
Next time on Simoun...

237
00:24:15,167 --> 00:24:15,927
The Nearby War
Next time on Simoun...

238
00:24:15,927 --> 00:24:19,627
The Nearby War
The Nearby War.
