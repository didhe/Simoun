1
00:00:00,948 --> 00:00:09,748
The countless flowers,
enveloped in light...

2
00:00:10,058 --> 00:00:20,558
...gaze at tomorrow
with unwavering eyes.

3
00:00:32,578 --> 00:00:39,538
Everyone wishes for me to be pure...

4
00:00:39,818 --> 00:00:46,948
...but what can I bring
with me to the frayed skies?

5
00:00:47,058 --> 00:00:54,118
What I've made my own
by breaking off flowers in bloom...

6
00:00:54,398 --> 00:00:59,698
All such sinful things...

7
00:00:59,808 --> 00:01:07,178
Why did I stop making
promises with the future?

8
00:01:07,278 --> 00:01:14,448
Because even if I try
to run far from all the pain...

9
00:01:14,548 --> 00:01:21,148
...a cold wind rustles
my hair... Don't you see?

10
00:01:21,258 --> 00:01:28,858
Where can I ever find the answer?

11
00:01:32,198 --> 00:01:34,498
You said it once yourself.

12
00:01:34,608 --> 00:01:37,628
That I should dismantle a Simoun.

13
00:01:37,908 --> 00:01:40,968
What's there is nothing but a helix.

14
00:01:41,078 --> 00:01:44,238
The only thing we're
capable of understanding is...

15
00:01:44,518 --> 00:01:48,248
You can see something!
What... What can you see?

16
00:01:52,258 --> 00:01:58,218
One, and Then Another

17
00:02:23,118 --> 00:02:24,518
What's that for?

18
00:02:24,618 --> 00:02:27,558
Oh, I'm going to use
these to build a cradle.

19
00:02:28,128 --> 00:02:29,288
A cradle?

20
00:02:29,388 --> 00:02:33,958
Where I grew up, we used to set
out cradles like this every spring.

21
00:02:34,068 --> 00:02:38,698
For those who passed too soon
to at least know a peaceful sleep.

22
00:02:47,108 --> 00:02:49,048
That one's too thick.

23
00:02:50,648 --> 00:02:52,208
How's Dominüra?

24
00:02:55,448 --> 00:02:58,578
I don't know what made
Dominüra break down, but...

25
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:01,448
...Rimone,
you should stay by her side.

26
00:03:01,558 --> 00:03:02,528
Why?

27
00:03:03,158 --> 00:03:06,758
Of us all, you're the one
closest to Dominüra.

28
00:03:16,268 --> 00:03:17,498
Aer!

29
00:03:30,358 --> 00:03:33,088
Neviril... So nothing happened?

30
00:03:33,488 --> 00:03:35,928
That's right. Nothing happened.

31
00:03:36,028 --> 00:03:40,558
The enemy's aerial base has
vanished. Though I don't know why.

32
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,698
And nothing else happened?

33
00:03:42,798 --> 00:03:43,858
No.

34
00:03:46,398 --> 00:03:47,458
What?

35
00:03:50,778 --> 00:03:52,138
Come on.

36
00:04:12,558 --> 00:04:15,828
I want you to tell me.
What did Dominüra see?

37
00:04:17,868 --> 00:04:23,068
I never should have touched
something so sacred after all.

38
00:04:25,978 --> 00:04:28,038
I never should have touched it.

39
00:04:39,018 --> 00:04:42,218
As you wish,
I'll never let you touch me again.

40
00:04:58,838 --> 00:05:00,368
So warm...

41
00:05:02,878 --> 00:05:05,508
You should get some rest today.

42
00:05:06,618 --> 00:05:09,988
But with Dominüra in that state...

43
00:05:10,718 --> 00:05:11,778
No...

44
00:05:17,598 --> 00:05:18,958
What's going on?

45
00:05:19,258 --> 00:05:22,198
We've spotted
the enemy at 11 o'clock.

46
00:05:22,298 --> 00:05:24,458
It seems they're not attacking, but...

47
00:05:24,568 --> 00:05:25,758
How's Dominüra?

48
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:28,698
She still seems quite indisposed...

49
00:05:29,008 --> 00:05:30,198
Excuse me!

50
00:05:31,808 --> 00:05:33,708
Let's go, Paraietta.

51
00:05:45,118 --> 00:05:46,888
Let's go, Neviril.

52
00:05:47,858 --> 00:05:52,758
Wait. Neviril is exhausted. She's in
no condition to go back up there.

53
00:05:52,858 --> 00:05:53,988
But...

54
00:05:54,098 --> 00:05:59,228
Dominüra is currently unable to pray,
so for now you'll obey my orders.

55
00:05:59,338 --> 00:06:01,238
Orders, she said?

56
00:06:01,338 --> 00:06:03,468
It sounds like the army.

57
00:06:10,048 --> 00:06:11,208
Fine.

58
00:06:17,718 --> 00:06:21,418
It's a scouting mission.
There's no need for Neviril to go.

59
00:06:21,528 --> 00:06:22,428
Kaim?

60
00:06:22,428 --> 00:06:23,658
Kaim?
Right.

61
00:06:44,248 --> 00:06:47,808
To think Aer would
just back down like that.

62
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:49,278
It was surprising.

63
00:06:49,388 --> 00:06:53,318
Before, she'd take her up even
if she had to drag her by the arm.

64
00:06:53,418 --> 00:06:55,948
I don't want to see Aer acting like that.

65
00:06:57,858 --> 00:07:01,858
The best thing about Aer is
she's almost aggressively positive.

66
00:07:01,968 --> 00:07:05,198
To see her being tactful...
It's not like her at all.

67
00:07:08,268 --> 00:07:09,738
Are you jealous?

68
00:07:09,838 --> 00:07:12,898
N-No! That's not how I feel about Aer!

69
00:07:13,008 --> 00:07:15,538
Hey, Rimone... Where's Aer?

70
00:07:16,378 --> 00:07:19,318
I just saw her leaving the ship...

71
00:07:20,048 --> 00:07:21,178
Leaving, huh?

72
00:07:21,288 --> 00:07:23,018
I wonder why she did?

73
00:07:23,118 --> 00:07:24,418
Who knows?

74
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:34,028
It's not what you think. I was just
thinking of showering or something.

75
00:07:34,128 --> 00:07:36,328
Nobody's asking, you know.

76
00:07:42,308 --> 00:07:43,668
Really now.

77
00:08:08,368 --> 00:08:09,558
Sorry.

78
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,188
What are you apologizing for?

79
00:08:13,498 --> 00:08:17,958
You can't even think of a reason to,
but you're just doing it anyway?

80
00:08:18,078 --> 00:08:19,738
I do have a reason.

81
00:08:21,808 --> 00:08:26,438
The reason you're in so much
pain, Neviril... I know it's my fault.

82
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:32,618
I don't know why that is, but it's my
fault... That much I know at least, so...

83
00:08:32,718 --> 00:08:34,588
Don't flatter yourself!

84
00:08:53,648 --> 00:08:54,698
Floe...

85
00:08:56,048 --> 00:08:58,208
That was so uncool.

86
00:08:59,148 --> 00:09:03,378
Please forgive me, Sibylla Aurea,
for speaking to you so rudely.

87
00:09:14,728 --> 00:09:16,198
They're so alike.

88
00:09:17,438 --> 00:09:20,558
Amuria... was just like that girl.

89
00:09:20,838 --> 00:09:23,898
She was never really looking at me.

90
00:09:24,478 --> 00:09:28,338
That's right...
I finally realized it because of Aer.

91
00:09:29,508 --> 00:09:31,478
In their eyes, I'm...

92
00:09:40,658 --> 00:09:44,688
...no more than a tool to help
them reach greater heights.

93
00:09:44,858 --> 00:09:46,158
Neviril...

94
00:09:51,598 --> 00:09:54,938
I think I might have made a mistake.

95
00:10:00,448 --> 00:10:01,408
With you...

96
00:10:01,478 --> 00:10:02,568
Don't say it.

97
00:10:02,678 --> 00:10:06,078
I'm not the person you think I am.

98
00:10:07,448 --> 00:10:11,678
If I'm not mistaken about
what you're about to say...

99
00:10:13,758 --> 00:10:17,218
I'm sure...
that it would make me waver.

100
00:10:24,938 --> 00:10:26,998
You're exhausted right now.

101
00:10:27,108 --> 00:10:29,398
You're not yourself. So please...

102
00:10:29,508 --> 00:10:30,968
I'm sorry.

103
00:10:33,178 --> 00:10:35,168
What have I done?

104
00:10:36,048 --> 00:10:37,948
I'm sorry, Paraietta...

105
00:10:38,618 --> 00:10:39,908
I'm sorry!

106
00:10:40,118 --> 00:10:41,548
Neviril...

107
00:10:51,598 --> 00:10:52,888
Again...

108
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:54,588
I'll go too.

109
00:10:54,698 --> 00:10:56,188
No. You should...

110
00:10:56,298 --> 00:10:57,428
But...

111
00:10:57,568 --> 00:10:58,728
Neviril...

112
00:11:04,008 --> 00:11:05,738
I'll go for heaven's sake!

113
00:11:06,138 --> 00:11:08,338
The air's not good here anyway.

114
00:11:08,448 --> 00:11:09,468
The air?

115
00:11:11,118 --> 00:11:12,478
All right, Alty?

116
00:11:12,578 --> 00:11:15,478
I guess, if that's what Floe wants.

117
00:11:16,018 --> 00:11:19,318
And the other will be flown
by Mamina and Roatreamon.

118
00:11:19,418 --> 00:11:20,718
Roger.

119
00:11:37,408 --> 00:11:39,468
I don't know about this...

120
00:11:39,578 --> 00:11:40,838
Aer?

121
00:11:40,948 --> 00:11:43,678
Yun and Kaim haven't
even come back yet...

122
00:11:43,778 --> 00:11:46,438
And if there's no attack,
for us to mobilize...

123
00:11:46,548 --> 00:11:49,518
Are you implying I've
made the wrong decision?

124
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:51,578
I never said that.

125
00:12:00,158 --> 00:12:02,718
I can't always be by your side.

126
00:12:03,168 --> 00:12:06,188
Even so, I can at least protect you.

127
00:12:07,168 --> 00:12:08,728
Neviril...

128
00:12:49,348 --> 00:12:51,208
It's so quiet...

129
00:12:52,518 --> 00:12:55,208
You're not going to hang
around the Simouns today?

130
00:12:56,618 --> 00:12:58,318
Well, no.

131
00:13:02,758 --> 00:13:04,278
Wanna play hide-and-seek?

132
00:13:04,358 --> 00:13:05,798
Treated like a child...

133
00:13:05,858 --> 00:13:07,188
Well, Aer?

134
00:13:07,298 --> 00:13:09,268
Sure! Sounds good.

135
00:13:12,838 --> 00:13:16,428
All right, Morinas, count to 100.
No cheating, got that?

136
00:13:16,538 --> 00:13:17,968
I know.

137
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:19,268
Here goes.

138
00:13:19,378 --> 00:13:21,108
One, two, three, four...

139
00:13:21,108 --> 00:13:23,478
One, two, three, four...
Rimone! Go hide!

140
00:13:23,578 --> 00:13:32,178
...five, six, seven, eight,
nine, ten, eleven, twelve...

141
00:13:32,288 --> 00:13:33,808
This way!

142
00:13:53,378 --> 00:13:58,308
...as blue as a tear.

143
00:13:59,448 --> 00:14:04,978
As white as a lily...

144
00:14:08,158 --> 00:14:13,388
In the pitch-black darkness...

145
00:14:15,468 --> 00:14:20,368
...the light of a red flame...

146
00:14:21,538 --> 00:14:23,128
That song...

147
00:14:24,138 --> 00:14:26,468
It's from Aer's music box...

148
00:14:26,578 --> 00:14:29,268
The doorway to a new frontier.

149
00:14:30,348 --> 00:14:34,978
For those who seek a land
of peace... The immigrants' song.

150
00:14:41,158 --> 00:14:46,458
Tempus Spatium embraced us, those
whom had no place to call home.

151
00:14:48,368 --> 00:14:52,498
Chor Dextra was created
to perform the Emerald Ri Majon...

152
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:57,828
Its soldiers were recruited for their
willingness to lay down their lives.

153
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:00,408
But none of that mattered to me.

154
00:15:00,508 --> 00:15:04,738
In return for my death,
Kyuukoku actually needed me.

155
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:07,838
And I wanted to feel needed.

156
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:11,078
That was what I'd always... always...

157
00:15:11,718 --> 00:15:13,118
That's why...

158
00:15:14,488 --> 00:15:17,218
You're still needed. Because I...

159
00:15:17,328 --> 00:15:21,458
I want to do the Emerald Ri Majon.
I want to do it with you, Dominüra.

160
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:25,128
But why?

161
00:15:26,538 --> 00:15:28,508
Because you're my pair.

162
00:15:45,818 --> 00:15:48,948
Sibylla Paraietta, the rain
is coming down harder.

163
00:15:49,328 --> 00:15:52,418
This can't be good for
your health. Please go inside.

164
00:16:33,068 --> 00:16:34,938
What's the matter?

165
00:16:38,838 --> 00:16:41,178
Do you need to see Dominüra?

166
00:16:41,678 --> 00:16:42,738
No.

167
00:16:51,918 --> 00:16:56,658
Why am I so indecisive? I've got
to do something, or I'll lose Neviril...

168
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:20,868
Another attack.

169
00:17:32,058 --> 00:17:34,618
It doesn't make sense, you know.

170
00:17:34,728 --> 00:17:37,928
Shouldn't we wait for Dominüra
to get back to normal?

171
00:17:38,038 --> 00:17:41,198
Can't you do anything without
Dominüra instructing you?

172
00:17:41,308 --> 00:17:43,638
This is no time for petty nitpicking.

173
00:17:44,108 --> 00:17:46,008
Petty, you say?

174
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:48,578
Seriously, at this rate...

175
00:17:48,678 --> 00:17:49,768
Aer!

176
00:17:54,488 --> 00:17:56,148
Pair up with me.

177
00:17:57,248 --> 00:17:59,588
You and I will patrol. From now on...

178
00:17:59,688 --> 00:18:00,918
No.

179
00:18:01,028 --> 00:18:02,578
I'm going.

180
00:18:04,498 --> 00:18:05,328
Neviril!

181
00:18:05,328 --> 00:18:06,428
Neviril!
Morinas, come with me.

182
00:18:06,428 --> 00:18:07,858
Morinas, come with me.

183
00:18:08,298 --> 00:18:09,428
Me?

184
00:18:09,568 --> 00:18:11,898
Neviril, you can't go. You're still...

185
00:18:11,998 --> 00:18:13,128
Please.

186
00:18:13,238 --> 00:18:15,298
Let me go, Paraietta.

187
00:18:50,908 --> 00:18:52,538
I'm so...

188
00:18:53,278 --> 00:18:54,638
...powerless.

189
00:19:28,748 --> 00:19:31,538
What about our game
of hide-and-seek?

190
00:19:39,358 --> 00:19:41,048
She's going to die.

191
00:19:42,888 --> 00:19:44,288
Dominüra...

192
00:19:46,628 --> 00:19:50,788
People who are about to die
have that look in their eyes.

193
00:19:52,098 --> 00:19:53,258
Rimone...

194
00:20:13,018 --> 00:20:14,578
Dominüra.

195
00:20:23,098 --> 00:20:26,158
Dominüra, I want you
to tell me what you think.

196
00:20:26,268 --> 00:20:28,898
What's your read on this situation?

197
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,178
Dominüra!

198
00:20:38,948 --> 00:20:40,578
Don't ask me.

199
00:20:41,648 --> 00:20:45,138
Could the judgment of
someone who's been asleep...

200
00:20:45,258 --> 00:20:47,948
...be less questionable
than your own?

201
00:21:03,938 --> 00:21:05,198
Dominüra.

202
00:21:05,878 --> 00:21:07,938
Another helping please.

203
00:21:20,758 --> 00:21:22,748
The Emerald Ri Majon...

204
00:21:24,188 --> 00:21:26,658
By dismantling a Simoun...

205
00:21:26,758 --> 00:21:30,698
...I think that I've seen what
lies beyond its completion.

206
00:21:34,298 --> 00:21:36,598
You only think you did, right?

207
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:39,968
You can't be sure
unless you really do it.

208
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,838
There's no other way, is there?

209
00:21:47,318 --> 00:21:51,448
The only thing you've ever
been asked to do was to fly high...

210
00:21:53,088 --> 00:21:56,888
To inscribe Ri Majons across
the vast sky. That's precisely why...

211
00:21:56,988 --> 00:22:02,188
To be denied this would be the same
as having your own existence denied.

212
00:22:05,838 --> 00:22:08,358
You and I are very much alike.

213
00:22:08,468 --> 00:22:10,408
I chose you.

214
00:22:10,808 --> 00:22:12,898
And you chose me.

215
00:22:14,138 --> 00:22:18,438
If it's that link between us that
makes a Ri Majon what it is...

216
00:22:19,148 --> 00:22:21,708
I'm going to do it for you.

217
00:22:30,228 --> 00:22:32,248
The Emerald Ri Majon.

218
00:22:41,508 --> 00:22:48,138
It is played by my wounds...
the song of prayer.

219
00:22:48,248 --> 00:22:52,378
Let it ring out over
the grieving universe.

220
00:22:52,478 --> 00:22:59,408
Can we change tomorrow?
Don't be afraid.

221
00:22:59,518 --> 00:23:07,158
I want to let you know
how my heart's overflowing.

222
00:23:15,908 --> 00:23:19,928
"I want to get closer to you."
"I want to feel your pulse."

223
00:23:20,038 --> 00:23:25,108
I was too defiant,
and I took the long way around.

224
00:23:25,218 --> 00:23:29,118
The blue moon is swaying silently.

225
00:23:29,218 --> 00:23:32,708
My true heart's desire is you.

226
00:23:33,158 --> 00:23:38,458
I can't reach you.
My tears of pain trickle down.

227
00:23:39,098 --> 00:23:44,528
Soar away into the sky, song of prayer.

228
00:23:44,638 --> 00:23:47,928
Carrying my love that came too late.

229
00:23:48,038 --> 00:23:53,638
What can I do to change tomorrow?

230
00:23:53,738 --> 00:23:59,878
Just hold on to "now" the way it is...

231
00:24:05,258 --> 00:24:06,788
To Be Continued

232
00:24:06,788 --> 00:24:06,918
To Be Continued
The Messis has finally...

233
00:24:06,918 --> 00:24:08,478
The Messis has finally...

234
00:24:08,588 --> 00:24:12,688
...become the target of
Shoukoku's mid-sized air fleet.

235
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:15,768
Next time on Simoun...

236
00:24:15,768 --> 00:24:16,928
The Emerald Ri Majon
Next time on Simoun...

237
00:24:16,928 --> 00:24:19,098
The Emerald Ri Majon
The Emerald Ri Majon.

238
00:24:19,098 --> 00:24:20,228
The Emerald Ri Majon
