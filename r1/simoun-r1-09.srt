1
00:00:00,781 --> 00:00:09,711
The countless flowers,
enveloped in light...

2
00:00:09,821 --> 00:00:20,161
...gaze at tomorrow
with unwavering eyes.

3
00:00:32,381 --> 00:00:39,311
Everyone wishes for me to be pure...

4
00:00:39,591 --> 00:00:46,721
...but what can I bring
with me to the frayed skies?

5
00:00:46,831 --> 00:00:53,891
What I've made my own
by breaking off flowers in bloom...

6
00:00:54,171 --> 00:00:59,471
All such sinful things...

7
00:00:59,571 --> 00:01:06,941
Why did I stop making
promises with the future?

8
00:01:07,051 --> 00:01:14,251
Because even if I try
to run far from all the pain...

9
00:01:14,351 --> 00:01:20,951
...a cold wind rustles
my hair... Don't you see?

10
00:01:21,061 --> 00:01:28,261
Where can I ever find the answer?

11
00:01:48,891 --> 00:01:50,681
I'm unsure too.

12
00:01:51,521 --> 00:01:53,491
About being a priestess.

13
00:01:53,591 --> 00:01:55,821
About going into battle.

14
00:01:56,761 --> 00:01:59,701
Whether those are
the right things to do.

15
00:01:59,801 --> 00:02:04,131
You and I are completely
different in every respect.

16
00:02:04,741 --> 00:02:07,331
But we're alike in just one way.

17
00:02:08,511 --> 00:02:10,071
Stand up, Aer.

18
00:02:10,841 --> 00:02:12,441
I am your pair.

19
00:02:13,211 --> 00:02:16,051
Everyone, hurry up
to the left flight deck!

20
00:02:16,151 --> 00:02:16,651
Hurry!

21
00:02:16,651 --> 00:02:17,771
Hurry!
All right!

22
00:02:25,261 --> 00:02:27,231
Mamina, let's go.

23
00:02:27,331 --> 00:02:29,821
Our Simoun is waiting for us.

24
00:02:30,601 --> 00:02:32,691
Isn't that why we're here?

25
00:02:38,771 --> 00:02:44,731
The Hearing

26
00:02:47,881 --> 00:02:51,411
I'll make them pay for
taking my big sister hostage.

27
00:02:54,351 --> 00:02:58,021
If our feelings go to pieces
again, I couldn't bear it.

28
00:02:59,691 --> 00:03:01,021
Are you scared?

29
00:03:01,561 --> 00:03:03,191
Not one bit.

30
00:03:03,301 --> 00:03:05,461
I'm scared.

31
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:11,701
Let's hurry.

32
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:18,371
Neviril and I are alike
in one way... What is it?

33
00:03:18,481 --> 00:03:22,351
Never mind. What matters is
that I'm Neviril's pair from now on.

34
00:03:24,951 --> 00:03:28,581
One second is enough. Right the ship.
We're launching the Simouns.

35
00:03:28,691 --> 00:03:30,921
Rubor and Caput were destroyed?

36
00:03:31,021 --> 00:03:33,081
Chor Tempest will be going out.

37
00:03:33,531 --> 00:03:37,831
Did you hear that? Keep the ship
level while Chor Tempest takes off!

38
00:03:38,361 --> 00:03:41,631
We'll launch a simultaneous
counterattack. There's no time to aim.

39
00:03:41,731 --> 00:03:43,171
Blast away!

40
00:03:52,311 --> 00:03:53,341
This is...

41
00:03:53,451 --> 00:03:56,381
Yes, the fuselage Amuria and I shared.

42
00:03:56,481 --> 00:03:57,881
It looks fixed.

43
00:03:57,981 --> 00:03:59,251
Let's go.

44
00:04:02,751 --> 00:04:05,721
You're Sibylla Aurea's
auriga. Do your best.

45
00:04:05,821 --> 00:04:06,981
Right.

46
00:04:29,721 --> 00:04:32,981
Jeez, our attacks
aren't connecting at all!

47
00:04:33,091 --> 00:04:36,111
They can't hit
anything from that position.

48
00:04:36,221 --> 00:04:37,881
We're plunging in, Yun!

49
00:04:37,991 --> 00:04:39,221
Look left!

50
00:04:40,191 --> 00:04:41,181
Neviril...

51
00:05:02,951 --> 00:05:05,011
We'll protect the Arcus Prima.

52
00:05:05,121 --> 00:05:07,211
Diamond Ri Majon.

53
00:05:33,051 --> 00:05:34,911
The Diamond Ri Majon...

54
00:05:35,011 --> 00:05:39,141
The Diamond Ri Majon can
neutralize the enemy bombardment.

55
00:05:39,551 --> 00:05:44,651
Right, it is one of the most difficult
defensive Ri Majons to execute.

56
00:05:45,161 --> 00:05:49,251
The helical motors on this ship
are barely functioning anymore.

57
00:05:49,361 --> 00:05:52,461
The only way is for
them to convey us...

58
00:05:53,131 --> 00:05:56,661
Leave it to them.
I'm sure Chor Tempest can manage...

59
00:06:00,871 --> 00:06:06,071
We'll hold the Diamond Ri Majon and
move out of the enemy's firing range!

60
00:06:06,181 --> 00:06:07,671
Okay, gotcha!

61
00:06:45,181 --> 00:06:50,951
The hearing will be held this
afternoon, as soon as we arrive.

62
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:55,421
We don't have much time to prepare.

63
00:06:55,531 --> 00:06:57,461
I'd like to take this time...

64
00:06:58,031 --> 00:07:02,361
...to once more go over what
happened with you, Sibylla Neviril.

65
00:07:03,871 --> 00:07:08,471
You will see your father,
Lord Harukonf, at the hearing.

66
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:48,741
You and I are completely
different in every respect.

67
00:07:48,851 --> 00:07:51,581
But we're alike in just one way.

68
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,711
Stand up, Aer.

69
00:07:54,751 --> 00:07:56,651
I am your pair.

70
00:08:18,411 --> 00:08:21,281
I wonder if Neviril's coming back.

71
00:08:21,981 --> 00:08:25,641
But even if Neviril does come back...

72
00:08:25,751 --> 00:08:27,981
...what difference would that make?

73
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,551
Listen, you...

74
00:08:31,861 --> 00:08:34,761
Just when we finally
got back to full strength.

75
00:08:34,861 --> 00:08:38,301
Just when I thought
we could all fly together again.

76
00:08:38,861 --> 00:08:41,831
No one's blaming
you anymore, Mamina...

77
00:08:43,341 --> 00:08:45,431
That's not what I meant...

78
00:08:46,611 --> 00:08:49,301
Looks like Dominüra
ran off somewhere too...

79
00:08:49,411 --> 00:08:51,601
Rimone, don't you know where?

80
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:53,371
Don't ask me.

81
00:08:53,911 --> 00:08:56,941
Even if Neviril does come back...

82
00:08:57,051 --> 00:09:00,451
...it's not as if we can
carry on as Chor Tempest.

83
00:09:00,551 --> 00:09:03,491
We'll just disband
with all members present.

84
00:09:03,591 --> 00:09:05,851
Oh, here you were.

85
00:09:05,961 --> 00:09:08,221
We've been looking for you.

86
00:09:08,331 --> 00:09:13,291
Chor Tempest sibyllae, it is almost
time for the ceremony to begin.

87
00:09:13,801 --> 00:09:17,791
I'd appreciate it
if you started getting ready.

88
00:09:22,741 --> 00:09:27,141
Nothing you did brought
about the desired results?

89
00:09:27,911 --> 00:09:33,011
It's too early. I still believe that
Chor Tempest has vast potential.

90
00:09:33,121 --> 00:09:34,711
For example?

91
00:09:34,821 --> 00:09:37,011
Neviril has returned.

92
00:09:37,121 --> 00:09:40,561
And two of the chor's
new recruits, Rimone and Aer...

93
00:09:40,661 --> 00:09:44,651
...possess latent talents
unlike any sibylla before.

94
00:09:45,731 --> 00:09:49,601
The sibylla in your report,
your favorite, Rimone, eh?

95
00:09:49,701 --> 00:09:54,371
True, Harukonf-sama's prodding
added two more sibyllae...

96
00:09:54,471 --> 00:09:58,501
...Sibylla Mamina and
Sibylla Yun, to Chor Tempest.

97
00:09:58,611 --> 00:09:59,601
Yes.

98
00:09:59,711 --> 00:10:02,481
But no matter how
convincing you are...

99
00:10:02,581 --> 00:10:06,181
...everything will be
decided soon in that room.

100
00:10:07,821 --> 00:10:13,381
Now that it's come to this, it would
be wise to switch to our next plan.

101
00:10:13,861 --> 00:10:14,981
But...

102
00:10:15,091 --> 00:10:19,551
...it was you who allowed the highland
agents to board the Arcus Prima.

103
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:22,761
Dominüra, this discussion is over.

104
00:11:00,241 --> 00:11:02,231
Forgive me, Neviril.

105
00:11:02,341 --> 00:11:06,541
But I only have your
best interests in mind.

106
00:11:06,641 --> 00:11:09,441
And your own too, Father.

107
00:11:10,151 --> 00:11:14,611
It is true Chor Tempest's record
is nothing short of dazzling.

108
00:11:14,721 --> 00:11:19,021
But the sibyllae have
destroyed it with their own hands.

109
00:11:19,121 --> 00:11:23,531
For Tempus Spatium's priestesses to
feud and go at each other's throats...

110
00:11:23,631 --> 00:11:27,961
...asserting themselves by baring
their basest instincts, is unthinkable.

111
00:11:28,231 --> 00:11:32,101
But what of our responsibility for
not recognizing the conference...

112
00:11:32,201 --> 00:11:36,471
...a sham, allowing Plumbum
to carry out its destructive plot.

113
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:42,001
Chor Tempest saved our precious
Arcus Prima from the enemy's ruse.

114
00:11:42,611 --> 00:11:45,451
Had it not been for
their excellence that day...

115
00:11:45,551 --> 00:11:48,451
...I wouldn't be
standing here right now.

116
00:11:48,991 --> 00:11:49,951
We...

117
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:54,121
No one granted permission
to speak, Sibylla Neviril.

118
00:11:54,231 --> 00:11:55,281
I do.

119
00:11:56,331 --> 00:11:57,451
Onasia...

120
00:12:00,471 --> 00:12:04,161
Sibylla Neviril, that day at the Spring...

121
00:12:04,771 --> 00:12:07,701
...I did indeed hear
Elly's wail of anguish.

122
00:12:11,711 --> 00:12:13,231
I'm afraid...

123
00:12:44,741 --> 00:12:49,541
Please say what you
have to say to everyone here.

124
00:12:50,721 --> 00:12:52,051
All right.

125
00:12:52,851 --> 00:12:57,881
We are all priestesses serving
Tempus Spatium, and as sibyllae...

126
00:12:57,991 --> 00:13:02,361
...we've listened to the Simouns and
drawn Ri Majons across the skies.

127
00:13:02,461 --> 00:13:07,451
And we have also killed scores of
soldiers from neighboring countries...

128
00:13:07,571 --> 00:13:10,591
...attempting to invade
Simulacrum Kyuukoku.

129
00:13:13,841 --> 00:13:15,171
Go on.

130
00:13:16,071 --> 00:13:19,601
What we carried out could
almost be called slaughter.

131
00:13:19,711 --> 00:13:24,051
We met a massive fleet of aircraft
from Shoukoku, and in the battle...

132
00:13:24,151 --> 00:13:28,951
It wasn't a battle.
How dare a sybilla speak like that...

133
00:13:29,721 --> 00:13:33,681
We have already lost three
of our beloved comrades.

134
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:38,961
As for Chor Caput, eleven of
their sibyllae have fallen in battle.

135
00:13:39,801 --> 00:13:45,001
When the highland priestesses
gave their lives in the plot...

136
00:13:45,101 --> 00:13:48,771
...to destroy the Arcus Prima,
even more lives were lost.

137
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:53,071
There was no deceit in
their devotion to their god.

138
00:13:53,181 --> 00:13:54,941
As priestesses ourselves...

139
00:13:55,051 --> 00:13:59,281
...what are we supposed to believe,
and how should we act?

140
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:01,681
We are waging war now.

141
00:14:02,251 --> 00:14:03,521
Enough...

142
00:14:04,021 --> 00:14:05,991
That's enough, Neviril.

143
00:14:08,131 --> 00:14:11,031
We are gathered here today...

144
00:14:11,131 --> 00:14:16,191
...because we must sadly bid farewell
to a number of our beloved friends.

145
00:14:16,801 --> 00:14:22,761
We traveled together and fought side
by side with these comrades of ours.

146
00:14:24,011 --> 00:14:27,711
Even for a time
of war, their departure...

147
00:14:27,811 --> 00:14:31,081
This was our original job, wasn't it?

148
00:14:31,751 --> 00:14:35,911
To offer flawless
Ri Majons to Tempus Spatium...

149
00:14:36,591 --> 00:14:39,351
We'll return to our
normal sibylla duties.

150
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:42,261
But I'm not sure how I feel.

151
00:14:43,131 --> 00:14:47,091
So you really wanted to mourn
the dead? That's pretty gloomy.

152
00:14:47,371 --> 00:14:51,101
Aer, that's not what I meant to say...

153
00:14:51,841 --> 00:14:57,601
This is the last Ri Majon we'll ever do
as Chor Tempest. Keep that in mind.

154
00:14:58,011 --> 00:15:01,841
I wonder if we're really
qualified to mourn the dead.

155
00:15:02,511 --> 00:15:05,181
Qualified or not, it's duty.

156
00:15:05,281 --> 00:15:09,081
I just want to get
this over with. That's all.

157
00:15:12,261 --> 00:15:15,561
Sibylla Paraietta,
please begin the ceremony...

158
00:15:15,661 --> 00:15:19,651
...to commemorate those who gave
their precious lives for their country.

159
00:15:19,761 --> 00:15:23,261
Yes, sir.
We'll offer the Ri Majon of the Fields.

160
00:15:23,901 --> 00:15:28,461
I am not looking to blame
anyone for this war we're waging.

161
00:15:28,571 --> 00:15:33,311
No matter how tragic and painful it
is now, I believe it was meant to be.

162
00:15:33,411 --> 00:15:36,681
Whether or not that is
Tempus Spatium's will...

163
00:15:36,781 --> 00:15:39,611
...it makes no difference to me now.

164
00:15:40,691 --> 00:15:44,621
I no longer even care whether
it's God's will anymore.

165
00:15:47,891 --> 00:15:51,761
However, I do have
one question for you all.

166
00:15:52,761 --> 00:15:57,361
Despite all this, can I still
call myself a Simoun sibylla?

167
00:15:59,901 --> 00:16:01,501
Sibylla Neviril...

168
00:16:02,971 --> 00:16:07,241
As long as you yourself wish it,
you may still consider yourself...

169
00:16:07,881 --> 00:16:10,251
...a Simoun sibylla.

170
00:16:11,421 --> 00:16:12,781
All right.

171
00:16:22,161 --> 00:16:26,431
Wait! You made a comment
we simply can't overlook.

172
00:16:26,531 --> 00:16:32,201
We can't allow you to get away with
saying you don't care about God's will.

173
00:16:32,301 --> 00:16:33,531
Please wait.

174
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:39,271
I have something to say to all of you.

175
00:16:43,611 --> 00:16:45,551
You're from Chor Rubor...

176
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:48,751
My name is Vura.

177
00:16:48,851 --> 00:16:50,251
I summoned her.

178
00:16:50,361 --> 00:16:53,451
Guragief, how dare
you take such a liberty?

179
00:16:53,561 --> 00:16:57,021
What is it that you
have to say? Sibylla Vura...

180
00:16:57,701 --> 00:16:59,031
...speak now.

181
00:16:59,701 --> 00:17:01,031
Onasia...

182
00:17:04,571 --> 00:17:05,901
I will.

183
00:17:06,001 --> 00:17:11,411
Chor Tempest is the chor all Simoun
sibyllae worship and take pride in...

184
00:17:11,511 --> 00:17:13,671
...the finest chor of all.

185
00:17:14,011 --> 00:17:16,781
On behalf of all Simoun sibyllae...

186
00:17:16,881 --> 00:17:20,441
...I beg you to consider
preserving Chor Tempest.

187
00:17:21,121 --> 00:17:25,451
Do you mean
Chor Tempest as sibyllae?

188
00:17:25,561 --> 00:17:29,961
Or Chor Tempest as
a squadron of warriors?

189
00:17:30,861 --> 00:17:35,771
You say you want us to preserve
Chor Tempest, but which one?

190
00:17:35,871 --> 00:17:38,061
Twelve sibyllae...

191
00:17:38,171 --> 00:17:42,471
...who become each other's pairs
and draw Ri Majons across the sky.

192
00:17:42,571 --> 00:17:45,841
There is only one Chor Tempest.

193
00:18:15,611 --> 00:18:17,301
Three o'clock!

194
00:18:18,481 --> 00:18:19,501
The enemy.

195
00:18:19,581 --> 00:18:21,041
Para-sama, look.

196
00:18:21,151 --> 00:18:22,541
I know!

197
00:18:24,021 --> 00:18:25,351
What is it?

198
00:18:25,451 --> 00:18:27,581
I've never seen anything like it.

199
00:18:29,551 --> 00:18:33,121
Is that a new type of cannon?
But I'm sure we can...

200
00:18:33,221 --> 00:18:37,821
Those are no cannons. They're
headed straight for the great temple.

201
00:19:05,091 --> 00:19:06,651
Let's go, Rimone.

202
00:19:06,761 --> 00:19:10,561
We'll disengage from the Ri Majon
and shoot those things down!

203
00:19:13,901 --> 00:19:18,961
Everybody's always ganging up
on us and making us suffer like this.

204
00:19:19,371 --> 00:19:21,031
I suppose we...

205
00:19:21,141 --> 00:19:23,441
This must be our fate...

206
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:26,911
One way or another,
we're bound to do Ri Majons.

207
00:19:43,531 --> 00:19:45,331
Mamina! Look!

208
00:19:47,601 --> 00:19:49,901
How can there be so many?

209
00:19:50,001 --> 00:19:53,631
Only the Iron Ri Majon
can destroy a fleet that size.

210
00:19:53,741 --> 00:19:58,611
We can't. It takes all six Simouns
to perform the Iron Ri Majon.

211
00:20:02,651 --> 00:20:04,911
The Iron Ri Majon...

212
00:20:38,581 --> 00:20:40,051
Neviril!

213
00:20:42,351 --> 00:20:44,381
What a lovely breeze.

214
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:46,991
Vura?

215
00:20:48,931 --> 00:20:51,051
Welcome back, Neviril!

216
00:20:51,161 --> 00:20:53,961
I've come home, everybody.

217
00:20:54,771 --> 00:20:58,961
I have good news. They won't
disband Chor Tempest after all!

218
00:20:59,601 --> 00:21:00,571
Goody!

219
00:21:01,241 --> 00:21:03,001
Isn't that great, Mamina?

220
00:21:03,111 --> 00:21:04,901
Yes, it's wonderful!

221
00:21:05,011 --> 00:21:06,841
Hey, what's the matter?

222
00:21:06,941 --> 00:21:12,041
I'm so happy. This means we can fly
our Simouns across the skies again.

223
00:21:12,721 --> 00:21:16,651
I'm so glad, Para-sama.
We'll be flying together again, right?

224
00:21:16,751 --> 00:21:19,281
What in the world
happened down there?

225
00:21:20,491 --> 00:21:24,791
Something must've
happened, right? Neviril, Vura!

226
00:21:34,111 --> 00:21:36,901
Now that Chor Tempest
won't be disbanded...

227
00:21:37,011 --> 00:21:40,141
...we must repair
the Arcus Prima at once.

228
00:21:40,241 --> 00:21:43,681
I wanted you to move on to
the next phase of your life.

229
00:21:43,781 --> 00:21:50,911
I can't lose face in the high council.
Chor Tempest can't go on as it has.

230
00:21:57,501 --> 00:22:01,931
Until the repairs on
the Arcus Prima are completed...

231
00:22:02,501 --> 00:22:07,941
...we'll board the Messis and be
charged with border reconnaissance.

232
00:22:08,511 --> 00:22:10,911
What? We're boarding that thing?

233
00:22:11,011 --> 00:22:12,411
I'm a bit...

234
00:22:12,511 --> 00:22:16,381
Don't be unreasonable. You should
just be thankful Chor Tempest...

235
00:22:16,481 --> 00:22:20,751
She's right.
That old boat should do just fine.

236
00:22:21,021 --> 00:22:23,451
I don't mind at all!

237
00:22:41,171 --> 00:22:47,841
It is played by my wounds...
the song of prayer.

238
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:52,081
Let it ring out over
the grieving universe.

239
00:22:52,181 --> 00:22:59,111
Can we change tomorrow?
Don't be afraid.

240
00:22:59,221 --> 00:23:06,791
I want to let you know
how my heart's overflowing.

241
00:23:15,611 --> 00:23:19,601
"I want to get closer to you."
"I want to feel your pulse."

242
00:23:19,711 --> 00:23:24,811
I was too defiant,
and I took the long way around.

243
00:23:24,921 --> 00:23:28,781
The blue moon is swaying silently.

244
00:23:28,891 --> 00:23:32,751
My true heart's desire is you.

245
00:23:32,861 --> 00:23:38,691
I can't reach you.
My tears of pain trickle down.

246
00:23:38,801 --> 00:23:44,231
Soar away into the sky, song of prayer.

247
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:47,671
Carrying my love that came too late.

248
00:23:47,771 --> 00:23:53,341
What can I do to change tomorrow?

249
00:23:53,441 --> 00:23:59,581
Just hold on to "now" the way it is...

250
00:24:04,961 --> 00:24:05,991
To Be Continued

251
00:24:05,991 --> 00:24:06,621
To Be Continued
Chor Tempest...

252
00:24:06,621 --> 00:24:07,561
Chor Tempest...

253
00:24:07,661 --> 00:24:12,621
...boards the antiquated ship Messis
and is on its way to the border.

254
00:24:14,401 --> 00:24:15,471
Next time on Simoun...

255
00:24:15,471 --> 00:24:17,171
Birds in a Cage
Next time on Simoun...

256
00:24:17,171 --> 00:24:19,501
Birds in a Cage
Birds in a Cage.
