1
00:00:01,008 --> 00:00:10,008
The countless flowers,
enveloped in light...

2
00:00:10,118 --> 00:00:20,618
...gaze at tomorrow
with unwavering eyes.

3
00:00:32,608 --> 00:00:39,278
Everyone wishes for me to be pure...

4
00:00:39,878 --> 00:00:46,978
...but what can I bring
with me to the frayed skies?

5
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:54,158
What I've made my own
by breaking off flowers in bloom...

6
00:00:54,468 --> 00:00:59,728
All such sinful things...

7
00:00:59,838 --> 00:01:07,208
Why did I stop making
promises with the future?

8
00:01:07,308 --> 00:01:14,478
Because even if I try
to run far from all the pain...

9
00:01:14,588 --> 00:01:21,218
...a cold wind rustles
my hair... Don't you see?

10
00:01:21,328 --> 00:01:28,728
Where can I ever find the answer?

11
00:01:30,938 --> 00:01:31,868
As planned...

12
00:01:31,938 --> 00:01:34,498
...with communication cables
intact, Chor Tempest...

13
00:01:34,568 --> 00:01:36,368
...will descend as low as possible...

14
00:01:36,438 --> 00:01:40,238
...and protect the Ruins from attack
by the Shoukoku-highland forces.

15
00:01:48,418 --> 00:01:49,508
The enemy?

16
00:01:49,588 --> 00:01:55,548
The Funeral

17
00:02:02,168 --> 00:02:05,428
This sibylla's spirit is
bound by chains of sin.

18
00:02:05,798 --> 00:02:10,468
Nevertheless, both the merciful
Tempus Spatium, as well as Kyuukoku...

19
00:02:10,538 --> 00:02:13,168
...are prepared to
forgive and accept her.

20
00:02:34,068 --> 00:02:37,298
But why the heck was Anglas lying
dead inside an ancient Simoun?

21
00:02:37,868 --> 00:02:39,598
That day, there's no
question that she...

22
00:02:42,738 --> 00:02:45,568
Aer!

23
00:02:52,378 --> 00:02:55,908
They never found so much as
a bone fragment in the debris.

24
00:03:04,258 --> 00:03:08,028
This sibylla has just received
the divine grace of Tempus Spatium.

25
00:03:08,468 --> 00:03:11,628
Now that she is about to set off
on a new journey, let us pray.

26
00:03:39,228 --> 00:03:40,788
She was a highland priestess.

27
00:03:41,128 --> 00:03:43,158
Not only that, but a spy.

28
00:03:43,228 --> 00:03:45,358
How can we hold a funeral
for her on the Arcus Prima?

29
00:03:45,468 --> 00:03:47,398
The high priestess felt it
was the right thing to do.

30
00:03:47,638 --> 00:03:49,398
And how did the
military council feel?

31
00:03:49,468 --> 00:03:52,598
That since the Highlands and
Shoukoku are now allies...

32
00:03:52,678 --> 00:03:55,538
...it wouldn't do to send
even the remains back to them.

33
00:03:55,608 --> 00:03:57,978
And yet they're so full
of mutual animosity.

34
00:03:58,278 --> 00:04:01,148
Yes, it seems they do agree
on the most unlikely thing.

35
00:04:01,888 --> 00:04:04,078
And that's what
causes trouble for us.

36
00:04:16,828 --> 00:04:19,228
You won't get a
breeze sitting here.

37
00:04:22,038 --> 00:04:23,298
Neviril.

38
00:04:23,678 --> 00:04:27,478
To think that you'd start a
conversation with me... Who knew?

39
00:04:32,978 --> 00:04:34,468
What happened at the Ruins...

40
00:04:36,848 --> 00:04:37,478
Yeah.

41
00:04:43,628 --> 00:04:44,358
Huh?

42
00:04:44,428 --> 00:04:45,158
What?

43
00:04:48,228 --> 00:04:49,288
The Spring.

44
00:04:53,538 --> 00:04:56,298
We found the Spring
inside the Ruins.

45
00:04:57,378 --> 00:04:58,868
And Onasia was there.

46
00:05:00,748 --> 00:05:01,798
This is...

47
00:05:02,348 --> 00:05:04,138
...the Spring itself.

48
00:05:05,218 --> 00:05:06,678
It's just like Grandpa said!

49
00:05:12,758 --> 00:05:16,058
And then we found Anglas, who
surely perished in that explosion...

50
00:05:16,128 --> 00:05:17,818
...inside an ancient Simoun.

51
00:05:18,728 --> 00:05:21,698
I'm thinking that Anglas
went there herself.

52
00:05:21,768 --> 00:05:22,428
What?

53
00:05:22,768 --> 00:05:23,888
In that moment...

54
00:05:23,968 --> 00:05:25,768
...the moment the Simoun exploded...

55
00:05:27,638 --> 00:05:29,068
...she went to a different world.

56
00:05:29,138 --> 00:05:30,158
A different...

57
00:05:30,778 --> 00:05:31,758
...world?

58
00:05:34,348 --> 00:05:37,178
Just when we thought we were
back home on the Arcus Prima...

59
00:05:37,248 --> 00:05:39,478
...all these weird
things started happening!

60
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:41,778
At least give us a
little downtime, right?

61
00:05:44,088 --> 00:05:45,558
There's no time to get comfortable.

62
00:05:45,618 --> 00:05:48,288
We're to go to the maju
pool right after this.

63
00:05:48,988 --> 00:05:50,518
I do like majus...

64
00:05:50,758 --> 00:05:52,958
...but not if we're
being ordered to do them!

65
00:05:53,058 --> 00:05:55,288
Wait, isn't that Neviril
and Aer over there?

66
00:05:59,298 --> 00:06:01,788
Hey, so they managed to make up!

67
00:06:02,168 --> 00:06:03,538
What do you mean, make up?

68
00:06:03,608 --> 00:06:05,768
Neviril was just having
a hissy fit on her own!

69
00:06:19,718 --> 00:06:22,418
W-Wait, Aer. What do you mean by...

70
00:06:24,658 --> 00:06:26,358
It's something Grandpa told me once.

71
00:06:32,098 --> 00:06:34,038
Hey, hurry up! This way!

72
00:06:35,008 --> 00:06:37,198
Grandpa, come on! Hurry!

73
00:06:37,278 --> 00:06:38,368
Aer!

74
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:41,538
This is as far as I can go.

75
00:06:41,948 --> 00:06:42,608
Huh?

76
00:06:42,678 --> 00:06:44,668
You go on ahead.

77
00:06:45,218 --> 00:06:49,048
Getting old means making
more and more choices.

78
00:06:50,048 --> 00:06:52,518
And with every choice you make...

79
00:06:53,018 --> 00:06:55,858
...you erase all
other possibilities.

80
00:06:56,258 --> 00:06:57,628
But I don't understand!

81
00:06:58,628 --> 00:07:01,558
The Simoun will show
you where you're headed.

82
00:07:02,768 --> 00:07:04,058
Where I'm headed?

83
00:07:06,998 --> 00:07:09,028
To a different world!

84
00:07:11,938 --> 00:07:15,308
What my grandpa meant by
that, I still don't know.

85
00:07:15,378 --> 00:07:18,078
But Grandpa was
always yearning for it.

86
00:07:18,718 --> 00:07:22,308
Aer, is that why you never
wanted to choose your gender?

87
00:07:26,688 --> 00:07:28,088
The helical motors...

88
00:07:28,658 --> 00:07:31,488
Said to manipulate
both time and space...

89
00:07:32,058 --> 00:07:34,828
I thought it was
no more than a story...

90
00:07:34,898 --> 00:07:37,328
...to strengthen the
mystery of the Simouns.

91
00:07:38,138 --> 00:07:39,658
"Everywhere...

92
00:07:39,738 --> 00:07:41,098
...and yet nowhere."

93
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,238
If that's true of Onasia...

94
00:07:46,308 --> 00:07:47,678
...and true of Anglas...

95
00:07:48,378 --> 00:07:49,608
...and true of the Simouns...

96
00:07:51,248 --> 00:07:52,608
Then maybe...

97
00:07:52,678 --> 00:07:54,618
...it's true of Rimone
and Dominüra as well.

98
00:08:00,828 --> 00:08:02,088
What we just talked about...

99
00:08:02,158 --> 00:08:04,148
Let's keep it between ourselves.

100
00:08:04,228 --> 00:08:05,988
So we're going to share a secret!

101
00:08:07,498 --> 00:08:08,588
Just the two of us!

102
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,188
Yes, we are.

103
00:08:16,068 --> 00:08:18,838
Why didn't you attend
Anglas's funeral?

104
00:08:18,908 --> 00:08:19,838
Those are the rules.

105
00:08:20,078 --> 00:08:21,868
A priestess from a
lowly family like mine...

106
00:08:21,948 --> 00:08:24,848
...has no right to
attend a holy ceremony.

107
00:08:25,318 --> 00:08:26,338
B-But why?

108
00:08:26,418 --> 00:08:27,348
You joined us the other time.

109
00:08:27,348 --> 00:08:28,508
You joined us the other time.
Things are different now.

110
00:08:28,718 --> 00:08:30,688
Our leaders are in turmoil.

111
00:08:30,788 --> 00:08:34,218
But they allowed an enemy
priestess's funeral to be held here.

112
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:36,758
You don't sound
like yourself at all.

113
00:08:36,928 --> 00:08:38,858
I thought you
liked that Anglas girl.

114
00:08:40,698 --> 00:08:41,528
But...

115
00:08:41,798 --> 00:08:42,358
But...

116
00:08:45,138 --> 00:08:47,498
I knew I'd have to face at least
this level of discrimination.

117
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:48,268
What?

118
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:51,798
The only reason I got to the rank
of Simoun sibylla was because...

119
00:08:51,878 --> 00:08:54,738
...I had the backing
of the vice chancellor.

120
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:56,368
Mamina.

121
00:08:57,418 --> 00:08:59,378
But the vice chancellor has changed.

122
00:09:00,788 --> 00:09:01,478
Hmph!

123
00:09:02,448 --> 00:09:04,388
He's nothing but a
senile old geezer now.

124
00:09:04,658 --> 00:09:06,558
W-Wait a minute, Mamina!

125
00:09:06,618 --> 00:09:10,148
I enjoyed our time on the Messis,
especially that mouse stew I made.

126
00:09:10,228 --> 00:09:10,888
Huh?

127
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:13,618
Watching all you oh-so-noble
priestesses taste that stew...

128
00:09:13,698 --> 00:09:16,428
...I thought, "Hey, they're
just the same as me!"

129
00:09:16,498 --> 00:09:17,898
That's right. We're the same!

130
00:09:20,238 --> 00:09:21,098
Nope.

131
00:09:21,308 --> 00:09:22,798
We're not the same after all.

132
00:09:29,048 --> 00:09:30,508
Mamina...

133
00:09:36,418 --> 00:09:37,718
Please wait a moment.

134
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:40,358
The maju pool is under the
jurisdiction of the chancellors.

135
00:09:40,658 --> 00:09:43,128
Should you set foot in this area...

136
00:09:43,188 --> 00:09:43,788
...the high priestess will...

137
00:09:43,788 --> 00:09:44,758
...the high priestess will...
It doesn't matter.

138
00:09:59,378 --> 00:10:00,568
Military Councilor.

139
00:10:01,408 --> 00:10:03,138
You must forgive us...

140
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,548
...but we can't have
so many observers.

141
00:10:05,618 --> 00:10:07,408
It will disturb our prayers.

142
00:10:07,548 --> 00:10:09,378
A maju is not a prayer.

143
00:10:09,448 --> 00:10:10,108
What?

144
00:10:10,388 --> 00:10:13,148
It is battle practice,
Sibylla Aurea.

145
00:10:15,358 --> 00:10:16,688
I'd like to see for myself.

146
00:10:17,088 --> 00:10:20,358
What Chor Tempest is
currently capable of...

147
00:10:20,428 --> 00:10:23,528
The Ri Majon with the
most destructive power!

148
00:10:40,748 --> 00:10:42,688
What a lovely wake
they're creating.

149
00:10:46,558 --> 00:10:48,078
The Dandelion Ri Majon?

150
00:10:49,428 --> 00:10:50,688
The one that harms no one...

151
00:10:51,628 --> 00:10:53,028
...that leads no one astray...

152
00:10:53,758 --> 00:10:54,868
...the one for ceremonies...

153
00:10:54,868 --> 00:10:55,458
...the one for ceremonies...
Hmph!

154
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:11,438
It's better this way.

155
00:11:11,978 --> 00:11:14,538
I didn't make the
wrong choice after all.

156
00:11:15,918 --> 00:11:18,908
Entrusting Aer to
become Neviril's pair...

157
00:11:19,758 --> 00:11:22,888
Yes, it's all good
because of that.

158
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:25,758
You have no clue whatsoever!

159
00:11:26,858 --> 00:11:29,728
Could the judgment of
someone who's been asleep...

160
00:11:29,798 --> 00:11:32,328
...be less questionable
than your own?

161
00:11:32,738 --> 00:11:35,468
Thinking someone
like you can protect her...

162
00:11:35,538 --> 00:11:37,168
...is gross arrogance.

163
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:40,608
I...

164
00:11:41,108 --> 00:11:41,768
...let Neviril...

165
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:46,368
I think...

166
00:11:46,818 --> 00:11:48,678
...I might have made a mistake.

167
00:11:52,988 --> 00:11:53,958
With you...

168
00:11:54,018 --> 00:11:55,078
Don't say it.

169
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:00,928
I think...

170
00:12:01,298 --> 00:12:03,158
...I might have made a mistake.

171
00:12:08,568 --> 00:12:10,468
I want to pair up with you.

172
00:12:11,608 --> 00:12:12,338
Yes.

173
00:12:12,878 --> 00:12:15,468
After all, I'm the one who
should be protecting you.

174
00:12:49,678 --> 00:12:51,908
Dismantle a Simoun...

175
00:12:53,618 --> 00:12:57,488
I never thought I'd hear those
words from anyone else but you...

176
00:12:57,558 --> 00:12:58,748
...Sibylla Dominüra.

177
00:13:00,718 --> 00:13:03,418
Forget about that day, Waporif.

178
00:13:05,928 --> 00:13:08,728
That's the last warning
I'll be giving you.

179
00:13:10,268 --> 00:13:12,238
But how could I ever forget?

180
00:13:12,738 --> 00:13:14,798
"Without something to believe in...

181
00:13:14,868 --> 00:13:17,068
...none of us can even
plant our feet on the earth."

182
00:13:17,438 --> 00:13:18,968
That's what you told me.

183
00:13:19,738 --> 00:13:21,708
Have you found
something to believe in?

184
00:13:23,548 --> 00:13:25,738
What am I supposed to do now?

185
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:35,588
What should I believe in?

186
00:13:48,938 --> 00:13:51,428
I have ordered
the maintenance crew...

187
00:13:51,508 --> 00:13:53,908
...to dismantle the ancient
Simoun as you instructed.

188
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:57,938
Dismantling a divine vessel.
How sacrilegious.

189
00:13:58,518 --> 00:14:00,008
Which is more sacrilegious?

190
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:03,678
Allowing our holy Tempus Spatium
to be tainted by outsiders?

191
00:14:05,618 --> 00:14:07,488
The topic for discussion today...

192
00:14:07,558 --> 00:14:10,458
...is what to do about
that enemy air base.

193
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:14,828
As most of the ancient Simouns
are now in the enemy's hands...

194
00:14:14,898 --> 00:14:17,228
...I believe it would be
dangerous to send Chor Tempest...

195
00:14:17,298 --> 00:14:18,168
...out on a reconnaissance mission...

196
00:14:18,168 --> 00:14:18,868
...out on a reconnaissance mission...
Then when would you deem it safe?

197
00:14:18,868 --> 00:14:20,598
Then when would you deem it safe?

198
00:14:21,538 --> 00:14:24,558
I understand your concern for
your daughter's well-being.

199
00:14:24,638 --> 00:14:27,168
However, should another
incident occur...

200
00:14:27,238 --> 00:14:31,678
...next time for sure, you won't have
a leg to stand on, Vice Chancellor.

201
00:14:33,378 --> 00:14:35,548
Who is paired up with Sibylla Neviril?

202
00:14:36,018 --> 00:14:37,608
That would be Sibylla Aer.

203
00:14:38,088 --> 00:14:40,418
Out of all the members
of Chor Tempest...

204
00:14:40,518 --> 00:14:42,788
...she has no parallel
as an auriga.

205
00:14:43,028 --> 00:14:44,548
Sibylla Aer?

206
00:14:44,858 --> 00:14:46,518
If I recall, her grandfather was...

207
00:14:48,798 --> 00:14:50,028
Even so, she herself...

208
00:14:50,498 --> 00:14:52,028
What is the meaning of this?

209
00:14:52,398 --> 00:14:54,028
Oh, please forgive me.

210
00:15:02,548 --> 00:15:03,878
Where are you taking her?

211
00:15:04,178 --> 00:15:05,268
Sibylla Yun.

212
00:15:05,618 --> 00:15:07,638
Anglas's funeral is long over.

213
00:15:07,788 --> 00:15:10,618
Shouldn't she have been committed
to the earth as soon as possible?

214
00:15:10,688 --> 00:15:12,948
This is an order from
the military councilor.

215
00:15:13,488 --> 00:15:14,678
The military councilor?

216
00:15:16,128 --> 00:15:18,958
How dare you debase a departed
spirit. I won't allow this to happen!

217
00:15:29,308 --> 00:15:33,938
Once you've left the cockpit of a
Simoun, a woman is utterly powerless.

218
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,448
It would be too
dangerous to sit back...

219
00:15:47,518 --> 00:15:49,958
...and do nothing about
that mobile air base.

220
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:54,458
We are hereby sending Chor Tempest
on a reconnaissance mission.

221
00:15:54,528 --> 00:15:56,828
The Messis shall serve
as the relay point...

222
00:15:56,898 --> 00:16:00,728
What? Just when we finally got away
from that musty, old rust bucket!

223
00:16:01,068 --> 00:16:03,728
I am happy to welcome
you all back, Sibyllae!

224
00:16:04,308 --> 00:16:05,238
Ugh...

225
00:16:05,638 --> 00:16:07,738
And if we discover the base?

226
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:10,238
That will be left to
your discretion, but...

227
00:16:10,308 --> 00:16:11,278
As for me...

228
00:16:11,348 --> 00:16:15,478
...I do believe you have the
capacity to blow it up at this point.

229
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:20,818
As both Sibylla Dominüra and Sibylla
Rimone are missing in action...

230
00:16:20,888 --> 00:16:23,828
...we will have to
readjust your pairings.

231
00:16:24,798 --> 00:16:27,728
Sibylla Paraietta and Sibylla Kaim.

232
00:16:29,828 --> 00:16:32,168
Sibylla Alty and Sibylla Floe.

233
00:16:32,468 --> 00:16:35,168
Sibylla Roatreamon and Sibylla Morinas.

234
00:16:35,668 --> 00:16:37,228
Sibylla Neviril...

235
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:39,468
...and Sibylla Mamina.

236
00:16:41,248 --> 00:16:43,438
Sibylla Yun and Sibylla Aer...

237
00:16:44,278 --> 00:16:47,678
It's been decided that you two will
sit out this particular mission.

238
00:16:49,148 --> 00:16:52,278
What are you talking about?
Why am I being left behind?

239
00:16:54,488 --> 00:16:56,188
Aer is my pair.

240
00:16:56,788 --> 00:16:58,918
You'll have to convince me as well!

241
00:17:02,428 --> 00:17:03,488
Neviril...

242
00:17:04,568 --> 00:17:07,298
Please, don't cause
any more trouble for me.

243
00:17:24,758 --> 00:17:26,808
What's the matter?
You can't sleep, Neviril?

244
00:17:27,418 --> 00:17:28,148
No.

245
00:17:28,788 --> 00:17:31,628
Your maju this afternoon.
It was magnificent.

246
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:33,548
Thank you.

247
00:17:38,298 --> 00:17:40,428
How about... a dance?

248
00:17:41,138 --> 00:17:43,438
I'm sorry. I'm not in the mood.

249
00:17:48,348 --> 00:17:49,438
What?

250
00:18:05,698 --> 00:18:08,668
I never thought you'd
stand up for Aer.

251
00:18:09,468 --> 00:18:11,798
It's not that I've opened
up to her completely.

252
00:18:12,468 --> 00:18:15,028
But by coming face
to face with Aer...

253
00:18:15,108 --> 00:18:16,938
...I'm also coming face
to face with Amuria...

254
00:18:17,008 --> 00:18:19,808
...meaning I'm facing
up to myself as well.

255
00:18:23,008 --> 00:18:26,008
That may have been my
greatest fear all this time.

256
00:18:28,848 --> 00:18:31,148
And I was just trying to avoid it.

257
00:18:31,618 --> 00:18:34,818
I've allowed you all to
humor me far too long.

258
00:18:35,988 --> 00:18:37,318
So let me humor you.

259
00:18:39,728 --> 00:18:40,788
Paraietta.

260
00:18:41,998 --> 00:18:44,158
You can go ahead
and lean on me.

261
00:18:47,138 --> 00:18:48,698
But at this rate...

262
00:18:48,768 --> 00:18:50,008
...I won't make it to a different world.

263
00:18:50,008 --> 00:18:50,598
...I won't make it to a different world.
What?

264
00:18:51,438 --> 00:18:53,168
Nothing, never mind
what I just said.

265
00:19:00,418 --> 00:19:01,708
A different world, you say?

266
00:19:03,118 --> 00:19:05,048
If it's a different
world you long for...

267
00:19:05,118 --> 00:19:06,518
...then I'll show you one now!

268
00:19:07,718 --> 00:19:08,418
Parai...

269
00:20:01,108 --> 00:20:01,978
What is it?

270
00:20:02,908 --> 00:20:03,678
You're awake?

271
00:20:04,148 --> 00:20:05,768
Yun's fast asleep, I think.

272
00:20:06,448 --> 00:20:09,748
I just thought you might
be too nervous to sleep.

273
00:20:10,048 --> 00:20:12,318
Pairing up with Sibylla Aurea...

274
00:20:12,388 --> 00:20:17,518
...I always saw that as the
fastest way to achieve my goals.

275
00:20:17,728 --> 00:20:18,588
Right.

276
00:20:19,098 --> 00:20:21,028
But I don't want you
to get the wrong idea.

277
00:20:21,128 --> 00:20:21,758
What?

278
00:20:22,298 --> 00:20:25,498
Deep down, I do want the rest
of you to see me as an equal.

279
00:20:25,598 --> 00:20:26,528
But...

280
00:20:26,598 --> 00:20:28,538
...not for the same
reasons as before.

281
00:20:30,268 --> 00:20:31,238
It's because...

282
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:35,698
...I really want to be
friends with you all.

283
00:20:39,448 --> 00:20:40,778
Mamina...

284
00:20:41,688 --> 00:20:43,848
So stop saying things like,
"We're friends," will you?

285
00:20:43,918 --> 00:20:46,008
It's just a matter of
how you feel about me.

286
00:20:47,488 --> 00:20:48,478
Okay.

287
00:20:50,228 --> 00:20:53,818
Mamina, do you want me
to sing you a lullaby?

288
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:56,628
You mean the one
you sang for Rimone?

289
00:20:57,128 --> 00:20:59,298
Give me a break!
I'm not a child.

290
00:20:59,668 --> 00:21:05,368
Hear the echo...

291
00:21:05,438 --> 00:21:06,678
Sorry, not listening.

292
00:21:06,678 --> 00:21:07,308
Sorry, not listening.
...of the swirling light...

293
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:12,338
...of the swirling light...

294
00:21:13,418 --> 00:21:24,988
...bringing us tales of joy.

295
00:21:28,428 --> 00:21:36,738
Proof that an
eternal world exists...

296
00:21:36,808 --> 00:21:43,678
...shall be revealed
by Tempus Spatium.

297
00:21:44,148 --> 00:21:46,548
Rocking gently until
we awake tomorrow...

298
00:21:46,618 --> 00:21:48,448
Why do you think they
took you off the mission?

299
00:21:48,818 --> 00:21:50,618
I have a pretty good idea.

300
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:51,848
You do, huh?

301
00:21:52,088 --> 00:21:52,988
What about you?

302
00:21:53,218 --> 00:21:54,708
There's something that bothers me.

303
00:21:54,858 --> 00:21:55,518
What's that?

304
00:21:56,688 --> 00:21:57,818
I can't tell you...

305
00:21:58,598 --> 00:21:59,788
...because I promised not to.

306
00:22:00,098 --> 00:22:01,058
I see.

307
00:22:01,298 --> 00:22:02,768
That's wise of you.

308
00:22:03,528 --> 00:22:07,028
Promises are made
to be kept after all.

309
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:22,308
I've got to go now.

310
00:22:22,688 --> 00:22:23,778
As do I.

311
00:22:41,398 --> 00:22:48,038
It is played by my wounds...
the song of prayer.

312
00:22:48,148 --> 00:22:52,278
Let it ring out over
the grieving universe.

313
00:22:52,378 --> 00:22:59,348
Can we change tomorrow?
Don't be afraid.

314
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:07,018
I want to let you know
how my heart's overflowing.

315
00:23:15,838 --> 00:23:19,828
I want to get closer to you.
I want to feel your pulse.

316
00:23:19,938 --> 00:23:25,008
I was too defiant,
and I took the long way around.

317
00:23:25,118 --> 00:23:28,978
The blue moon is swaying silently.

318
00:23:29,088 --> 00:23:33,018
My true heart's desire is you.

319
00:23:33,118 --> 00:23:38,888
I can't reach you.
My tears of pain trickle down.

320
00:23:38,998 --> 00:23:44,428
Soar away into the
sky, song of prayer.

321
00:23:44,528 --> 00:23:47,868
Carrying my love that came too late.

322
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:53,528
What can I do to change tomorrow?

323
00:23:53,638 --> 00:23:59,838
Just hold on to "now" the way it is...

324
00:24:05,288 --> 00:24:06,718
To Be Continued

325
00:24:06,718 --> 00:24:06,958
To Be Continued
Neviril's Simoun is shot down...

326
00:24:06,958 --> 00:24:08,948
Neviril's Simoun is shot down...

327
00:24:09,028 --> 00:24:13,428
...and forced to make an emergency
landing on Shoukoku's aerial base.

328
00:24:14,398 --> 00:24:15,758
Next time on Simoun...

329
00:24:15,828 --> 00:24:16,768
Sibylla

330
00:24:16,768 --> 00:24:17,728
Sibylla
Sibylla.

331
00:24:17,728 --> 00:24:20,258
Sibylla
