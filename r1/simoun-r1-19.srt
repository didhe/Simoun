1
00:00:00,638 --> 00:00:09,638
The countless flowers,
enveloped in light...

2
00:00:09,748 --> 00:00:20,248
...gaze at tomorrow
with unwavering eyes.

3
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:38,898
Everyone wishes for me to be pure...

4
00:00:39,508 --> 00:00:46,608
...but what can I bring
with me to the frayed skies?

5
00:00:46,718 --> 00:00:53,778
What I've made my own
by breaking off flowers in bloom...

6
00:00:54,088 --> 00:00:59,358
All such sinful things...

7
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:06,838
Why did I stop making
promises with the future?

8
00:01:06,938 --> 00:01:14,108
Because even if I try
to run far from all the pain...

9
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:20,838
...a cold wind rustles
my hair... Don't you see?

10
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:28,358
Where can I ever find the answer?

11
00:01:31,128 --> 00:01:33,148
It would be too
dangerous to sit back...

12
00:01:33,228 --> 00:01:35,558
...and do nothing about
that mobile air base.

13
00:01:36,398 --> 00:01:39,998
We are hereby sending the Chor
Tempest on a reconnaissance mission.

14
00:01:40,068 --> 00:01:42,658
The Messis shall serve
as the relay point...

15
00:01:42,738 --> 00:01:44,868
And if we discover the base?

16
00:01:45,278 --> 00:01:47,268
That will be left to
your discretion, but...

17
00:01:47,338 --> 00:01:48,308
As for me...

18
00:01:48,378 --> 00:01:52,608
I do believe you have the capacity
to blow it up at this point.

19
00:02:05,998 --> 00:02:07,898
Why do you think they
took you off the mission?

20
00:02:08,398 --> 00:02:10,258
I have a pretty good idea.

21
00:02:10,398 --> 00:02:11,368
You do, huh?

22
00:02:11,438 --> 00:02:12,398
What about you?

23
00:02:12,798 --> 00:02:14,328
There's something that I
can't quite put my finger on.

24
00:02:14,498 --> 00:02:15,398
And what would that be?

25
00:02:16,308 --> 00:02:17,428
I can't tell you.

26
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,438
Because I promised not to.

27
00:02:25,118 --> 00:02:27,378
I've got to go now.

28
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:28,718
As do I.

29
00:02:29,688 --> 00:02:35,648
Sibylla

30
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:47,038
As if Sibylla Aer would
ever do as she's told.

31
00:02:47,138 --> 00:02:49,228
Are you really
going to let this go?

32
00:02:49,308 --> 00:02:52,668
Honestly, this makes me wonder
what the sibyllae are thinking.

33
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:54,278
You're absolutely right.

34
00:02:55,248 --> 00:02:59,148
What I would give for that
kind of single-minded passion...

35
00:03:02,618 --> 00:03:04,378
What is the meaning
of that Simoun?

36
00:03:04,448 --> 00:03:05,148
Captain!

37
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:12,648
Who's that?

38
00:03:12,758 --> 00:03:15,628
I believe it's Sibylla
Aer and Sibylla Yun.

39
00:03:16,828 --> 00:03:17,798
I see.

40
00:03:18,538 --> 00:03:21,098
Sibylla Aer and Sibylla Yun.

41
00:03:34,178 --> 00:03:35,168
Vura!

42
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:38,918
After Chor Rubor was
disbanded, these two sibyllae...

43
00:03:38,988 --> 00:03:42,688
...were assigned to the
Messis as your replacements...

44
00:03:42,758 --> 00:03:45,088
...and have been on
reconnaissance duty ever since.

45
00:03:45,398 --> 00:03:46,358
Good job.

46
00:03:46,858 --> 00:03:49,558
This is all that we have
to offer at this point.

47
00:03:51,968 --> 00:03:54,268
We heard about Dominüra and Rimone.

48
00:03:54,338 --> 00:03:56,198
But where are Aer and Yun?

49
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:59,938
Those two will be
sitting out this mission.

50
00:04:01,238 --> 00:04:03,798
There'll be plenty of
time to discuss that later.

51
00:04:03,878 --> 00:04:05,678
Sibyllae, won't you
please come inside.

52
00:04:05,748 --> 00:04:08,218
We should go over the
details of our mission, and...

53
00:04:09,448 --> 00:04:12,678
First of all, I'd like
you to get some rest.

54
00:04:17,158 --> 00:04:19,588
It's a little early,
but I'm going on ahead.

55
00:04:19,658 --> 00:04:21,488
I'll meet you in the
dining room in half an hour.

56
00:04:22,068 --> 00:04:24,188
Right. I'll be along soon.

57
00:04:41,418 --> 00:04:43,408
Oh, it's you, Roatre!
What's going on?

58
00:04:43,848 --> 00:04:45,748
Well, you were
taking so long, Mamina!

59
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:46,618
Was I?

60
00:04:47,118 --> 00:04:47,818
Let's go!

61
00:04:50,058 --> 00:04:51,358
Oh, Mamina.

62
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,518
What? What's wrong?

63
00:04:52,598 --> 00:04:54,588
Your braids are
starting to come undone!

64
00:04:54,798 --> 00:04:55,768
What?

65
00:04:56,128 --> 00:04:59,068
I'll fix them for you.
We still have time anyway!

66
00:05:13,778 --> 00:05:15,948
Those Simouns we
saw at the Ruins...

67
00:05:16,018 --> 00:05:19,508
...do you think they've made it
back to the highlands' base station?

68
00:05:19,588 --> 00:05:20,558
Probably.

69
00:05:20,888 --> 00:05:22,418
But there's nothing to worry about.

70
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:25,588
You're paired up with Morinas,
and she's an excellent auriga.

71
00:05:26,058 --> 00:05:27,218
Yes, she is.

72
00:05:27,558 --> 00:05:30,028
And even if something
should go wrong somehow...

73
00:05:30,098 --> 00:05:31,758
...I'll be there to protect you!

74
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:32,828
Right.

75
00:05:37,008 --> 00:05:37,868
Even so...

76
00:05:38,778 --> 00:05:41,568
This is just a reconnaissance
mission after all.

77
00:05:41,848 --> 00:05:45,868
It would be better if we could avoid
going into battle at all, wouldn't it?

78
00:05:46,878 --> 00:05:48,078
Yes, it would.

79
00:05:48,718 --> 00:05:51,278
That would be the
best of all, right?

80
00:05:51,348 --> 00:05:52,078
Right!

81
00:05:52,788 --> 00:05:54,878
Thanks to the data these two
have gathered on patrol...

82
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:58,828
...we've narrowed down the Shoukoku
air base's approximate location...

83
00:05:58,898 --> 00:06:01,088
...to this region right here.

84
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:03,598
In those defenseless Similes?

85
00:06:03,998 --> 00:06:07,058
Sibylla Aurea, we two will
hold the rearguard position...

86
00:06:07,138 --> 00:06:10,538
...and relay all
communications from the Messis.

87
00:06:10,608 --> 00:06:11,468
The rest...

88
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:12,298
I know.

89
00:06:12,508 --> 00:06:13,598
The rest is up to us.

90
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:16,198
There's no getting around the fact
that the gap between the Similes...

91
00:06:16,278 --> 00:06:18,368
...and the Simouns in terms
of mobility is far too great.

92
00:06:18,448 --> 00:06:21,678
Putting together a mixed unit like
this... It's just not feasible.

93
00:06:22,388 --> 00:06:23,478
Just leave it to us!

94
00:06:23,848 --> 00:06:26,248
There you go making rash
promises again, Floe.

95
00:06:26,318 --> 00:06:27,718
What do you mean "again"?

96
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:29,648
Would you knock it off?
Both of you!

97
00:06:29,728 --> 00:06:31,348
But Alty's the one who...

98
00:06:35,298 --> 00:06:36,888
Let's try to get along, people!

99
00:06:36,968 --> 00:06:40,398
Come on, we're comrades. We all
ate from the same pot, remember?

100
00:06:40,498 --> 00:06:41,598
Don't say it, Mamina!

101
00:06:43,468 --> 00:06:45,128
Oh, um, don't mind me...

102
00:06:46,178 --> 00:06:48,338
Please continue, Captain.

103
00:06:49,878 --> 00:06:50,848
Very well.

104
00:06:51,048 --> 00:06:53,708
First, we'll have the
members of Chor Tempest...

105
00:06:53,778 --> 00:06:55,878
That Mamina's changed, hasn't she?

106
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:56,918
Yes.

107
00:06:57,518 --> 00:07:00,388
By the way, what did you
not want her to say, Roatre?

108
00:07:01,358 --> 00:07:02,518
The mice.

109
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:11,398
Who knew Vura was flying
reconnaissance in a Simile?

110
00:07:11,468 --> 00:07:12,658
I had no idea.

111
00:07:12,838 --> 00:07:16,598
Right, and to make sure their
efforts don't go to waste...

112
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:19,598
...the rest of us need to be
in top form during this mission.

113
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:32,608
Sibylla Aurea, this is where
we're supposed to deploy.

114
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:33,548
You're right.

115
00:07:34,218 --> 00:07:36,558
Then we're going to proceed
according to plan. Understood?

116
00:07:36,828 --> 00:07:37,588
Roger!

117
00:07:47,168 --> 00:07:50,658
How can the center deploy
Chor Tempest in this state?

118
00:07:51,408 --> 00:07:54,068
It's just as Sibylla
Dominüra said to me once.

119
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:57,078
The center understands nothing!

120
00:07:59,018 --> 00:08:03,478
It will be a while before
Chor Tempest returns.

121
00:08:03,548 --> 00:08:06,318
I'd like you both to get
some rest while you can.

122
00:08:07,188 --> 00:08:10,058
It's part of our duty
to rest... correct?

123
00:08:10,558 --> 00:08:12,078
That's correct, Sibylla.

124
00:08:13,858 --> 00:08:17,028
Make sure you don't miss any
signs of Chor Tempest's return.

125
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:20,698
I want you to reiterate
that to the patrol unit!

126
00:08:20,938 --> 00:08:21,528
Yes, sir!

127
00:08:26,438 --> 00:08:27,408
Mamina...

128
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:32,248
They forbade you from attending
Anglas's funeral, didn't they?

129
00:08:33,018 --> 00:08:35,638
That is rather harsh of our
country, don't you think?

130
00:08:35,718 --> 00:08:37,478
Oh, no, Sibylla Aurea.

131
00:08:37,848 --> 00:08:40,148
The more tenuous a state
they find themselves in...

132
00:08:40,218 --> 00:08:44,158
...the more people try to cling to
the comfort of their conventions.

133
00:08:44,928 --> 00:08:45,788
You're right.

134
00:08:46,358 --> 00:08:49,558
Mamina, I can see that
you've changed after all.

135
00:08:50,228 --> 00:08:51,558
Do you think so?

136
00:08:53,168 --> 00:08:54,398
Gimme a break!

137
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:57,968
"I'm detaching the cables for
the time being." So she says!

138
00:08:57,968 --> 00:08:59,308
How annoying is that?

139
00:08:59,738 --> 00:09:03,578
So they must be having a private
conversation one adult to another.

140
00:09:03,648 --> 00:09:04,808
I say leave them alone.

141
00:09:06,718 --> 00:09:09,548
3 o'clock! There's a huge shadow
in that break in the clouds.

142
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:18,528
There.

143
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:20,558
Found it!

144
00:09:25,868 --> 00:09:28,498
We're going to keep the
communication cables intact...

145
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,228
...and approach from above.

146
00:09:30,338 --> 00:09:31,138
What?

147
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:32,668
But we've found the base.

148
00:09:33,108 --> 00:09:35,698
Those Simouns we encountered
at the Ruins could be here.

149
00:09:35,778 --> 00:09:36,908
We should find out for sure.

150
00:09:36,978 --> 00:09:37,838
Right.

151
00:09:37,908 --> 00:09:40,818
Let's just confirm that
before we head home, Floe.

152
00:09:41,118 --> 00:09:42,078
Okay.

153
00:09:42,588 --> 00:09:43,848
Don't let down your guard!

154
00:09:43,918 --> 00:09:46,678
There's a chance that the enemy
could be patrolling this area too.

155
00:09:46,888 --> 00:09:47,578
Right.

156
00:10:29,298 --> 00:10:30,388
Nothing here.

157
00:10:30,568 --> 00:10:33,828
If we go much farther, we'll be
leaving the patrol area, Para-sama.

158
00:10:34,168 --> 00:10:36,758
Don't you think we
should be heading back...

159
00:10:36,838 --> 00:10:38,568
...to our rendezvous
point with the regina?

160
00:10:39,578 --> 00:10:40,568
Para-sama?

161
00:10:48,318 --> 00:10:50,578
Let's patrol this
area a little longer.

162
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:51,918
Roger!

163
00:11:02,268 --> 00:11:04,128
There it is! The Messis!

164
00:11:06,998 --> 00:11:09,268
To the rear of our ship.
A single Simoun!

165
00:11:09,338 --> 00:11:12,138
Approaching at a rapid pace.
It's a Chor Tempest Simoun!

166
00:11:13,978 --> 00:11:14,878
Who are they?

167
00:11:14,938 --> 00:11:16,338
It's Aer and Yun!

168
00:11:22,288 --> 00:11:23,078
Vura!

169
00:11:23,848 --> 00:11:25,838
Who would've thought we'd
find Vura on board the Messis?

170
00:11:26,188 --> 00:11:27,878
Yes, it's quite surprising.

171
00:11:30,028 --> 00:11:31,188
Understood.

172
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:33,688
Actually, I was worried
about that myself.

173
00:11:34,198 --> 00:11:36,958
Sibylla Aer and Sibylla
Yun, please go on ahead.

174
00:11:37,498 --> 00:11:38,158
Right.

175
00:11:38,228 --> 00:11:39,328
Please, be careful.

176
00:11:39,568 --> 00:11:40,428
Thanks!

177
00:11:46,578 --> 00:11:47,338
Captain!

178
00:11:47,608 --> 00:11:49,598
I thought they might show up.

179
00:11:49,678 --> 00:11:50,478
So?

180
00:11:50,548 --> 00:11:52,608
Yes. Let's head that way ourselves.

181
00:11:52,848 --> 00:11:56,748
Channel all power from the
helical motors to the engines!

182
00:11:57,248 --> 00:11:59,378
We're heading for the
patrol zone at top speed!

183
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:00,108
Yes, sir!

184
00:12:10,868 --> 00:12:12,268
Hey, Para-sama!

185
00:12:14,898 --> 00:12:15,888
Para-sama!

186
00:12:18,108 --> 00:12:20,628
We're heading toward the
rendezvous point with the regina.

187
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:21,438
Right!

188
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:22,268
Roger!

189
00:12:51,308 --> 00:12:52,368
No, they've spotted us!

190
00:12:53,108 --> 00:12:54,168
Retreat at top speed!

191
00:13:08,088 --> 00:13:09,488
Para-sama, behind us!

192
00:13:20,168 --> 00:13:20,898
Para-sama!

193
00:13:21,498 --> 00:13:22,658
Come on, let's get going!

194
00:13:22,838 --> 00:13:23,398
Roger!

195
00:13:23,868 --> 00:13:24,398
Right!

196
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:43,388
We're going to keep going!

197
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:44,428
Shark Ri Majon!

198
00:13:44,728 --> 00:13:46,418
Roger! Shark Ri Majon!

199
00:13:56,108 --> 00:13:57,198
Can't shake them off!

200
00:13:57,268 --> 00:13:58,638
Those guys are way too fast!

201
00:14:10,448 --> 00:14:11,418
She just...

202
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:13,608
Neviril just told us
to make a run for it!

203
00:14:14,318 --> 00:14:15,348
But...

204
00:14:15,728 --> 00:14:16,618
Hurry!

205
00:14:16,688 --> 00:14:18,788
We should do as she says!

206
00:14:18,998 --> 00:14:21,188
Otherwise, both our
Simouns will be shot down.

207
00:14:21,358 --> 00:14:23,088
We've got to hurry back
and let the others know.

208
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:30,598
They're coming after us!

209
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:38,668
Hang in there. We'll come
back for you as soon as we can!

210
00:15:20,918 --> 00:15:22,048
Sibylla Aurea!

211
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:24,048
Neviril!

212
00:15:39,878 --> 00:15:40,838
Sibylla Aurea...

213
00:15:41,378 --> 00:15:42,568
Please have no fear.

214
00:15:42,648 --> 00:15:44,308
No matter what it takes, I'll...

215
00:15:58,998 --> 00:16:03,488
If you can understand what I'm
saying, then listen to me now!

216
00:16:04,228 --> 00:16:07,528
I'm nothing but
an unknown sibylla...

217
00:16:07,598 --> 00:16:09,658
...doomed to die in
such a place as this.

218
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:12,228
What do I care
about my own life?

219
00:16:12,678 --> 00:16:13,658
But...

220
00:16:13,908 --> 00:16:19,368
Behind me lies the finest sibylla
in all of Simulacrum Kyuukoku...

221
00:16:19,448 --> 00:16:21,418
...Sibylla Aurea Neviril!

222
00:16:22,218 --> 00:16:24,188
I'm getting her out
of here no matter what.

223
00:16:24,648 --> 00:16:28,178
And not one of you will lay
so much as a finger on her!

224
00:16:30,328 --> 00:16:31,188
No.

225
00:16:31,788 --> 00:16:33,258
Both the sibylla behind you...

226
00:16:33,328 --> 00:16:35,518
...and you yourself are
the finest of all sibyllae.

227
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:40,328
You two are sibyllae
from Simulacrum Kyuukoku.

228
00:16:40,668 --> 00:16:43,728
There's no one closer
to God than you.

229
00:16:44,538 --> 00:16:46,798
In our nation,
the Plumbum highlands...

230
00:16:46,878 --> 00:16:48,738
...you are respected
above all others.

231
00:16:49,448 --> 00:16:53,778
It is not our choice to
engage in battle with you.

232
00:16:54,248 --> 00:16:58,578
And it is not our will to
capture an injured sibylla.

233
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:00,488
You...

234
00:17:01,058 --> 00:17:04,388
We are priestesses of
the Plumbum Highlands.

235
00:17:04,888 --> 00:17:08,458
We're not the same as the Shoukoku
soldiers on board this ship.

236
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:12,398
The battle we have just
been waging is already over.

237
00:17:12,738 --> 00:17:15,328
There is no longer any
reason for us to fight.

238
00:17:16,868 --> 00:17:19,028
Please, you must believe us.

239
00:17:19,408 --> 00:17:21,808
If we were planning
to capture you...

240
00:17:21,878 --> 00:17:24,968
...then there would be no need
for us to go to all these lengths.

241
00:17:28,578 --> 00:17:29,608
Mamina...

242
00:17:30,488 --> 00:17:31,748
Sibylla Aurea?

243
00:17:33,088 --> 00:17:35,678
What those priestesses
are telling us...

244
00:17:35,758 --> 00:17:37,118
I am sure it is the truth.

245
00:17:48,398 --> 00:17:49,698
Please, you must hurry!

246
00:17:51,338 --> 00:17:52,068
Right.

247
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,168
Come, together now.

248
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:14,028
There's no time to lose!

249
00:18:14,028 --> 00:18:14,888
There's no time to lose!
Right.

250
00:18:21,298 --> 00:18:22,968
So that's what's
going to happen.

251
00:18:23,668 --> 00:18:25,698
If you four let us get
away from this base...

252
00:18:25,778 --> 00:18:27,828
...you'll have nowhere to go.

253
00:18:28,678 --> 00:18:32,508
No. If they capture you,
you are certain to be killed!

254
00:18:41,918 --> 00:18:45,828
You four recognized
me as a true sibylla!

255
00:18:46,728 --> 00:18:51,328
And if you let me escape, you'll
be put to death as traitors!

256
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:04,298
Farewell, Sibylla Aurea.

257
00:19:21,658 --> 00:19:23,188
Are you out of your mind?

258
00:19:29,808 --> 00:19:34,538
If you're planning to go to your
death at the hands of those soldiers...

259
00:19:34,608 --> 00:19:35,798
...then let me!

260
00:19:37,578 --> 00:19:39,068
This is how it should be.

261
00:19:40,248 --> 00:19:41,408
It's what I want.

262
00:19:44,088 --> 00:19:46,418
Let me say it in your language...

263
00:19:46,918 --> 00:19:48,908
Aer...

264
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:54,998
Aer!

265
00:20:03,808 --> 00:20:05,468
We've sighted a huge
shadow straight ahead.

266
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:07,408
Captain, we believe it's
Shoukoku's aerial base!

267
00:20:07,908 --> 00:20:09,168
And it appears to be on fire!

268
00:20:09,248 --> 00:20:11,408
All hands, take your
positions for battle level one!

269
00:20:11,848 --> 00:20:14,408
All hands, take your
positions for battle level one!

270
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,398
No, it's not true.

271
00:20:47,348 --> 00:20:49,538
All hands, brace
yourself for impact!

272
00:20:49,888 --> 00:20:51,938
All hands, brace
yourself for impact!

273
00:20:52,018 --> 00:20:54,578
Come on, we're going
to the priestesses' aid!

274
00:21:34,428 --> 00:21:35,518
Mamina!

275
00:21:36,298 --> 00:21:37,788
Let's hurry back
to the Messis!

276
00:21:37,868 --> 00:21:38,418
Right.

277
00:21:38,998 --> 00:21:39,698
No!

278
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:40,928
No!
Step back, Roatreamon!

279
00:21:40,998 --> 00:21:41,468
You're in our way!

280
00:21:41,468 --> 00:21:42,368
You're in our way!
Hurry!

281
00:21:42,438 --> 00:21:43,458
Mamina!

282
00:21:43,738 --> 00:21:44,828
Roatreamon!

283
00:21:44,938 --> 00:21:45,928
Aer!

284
00:21:46,378 --> 00:21:47,998
Come on, let's go, Roatreamon!

285
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:50,438
We've got to hurry too, Aer.

286
00:21:51,008 --> 00:21:51,978
Aer!

287
00:21:54,078 --> 00:21:56,478
We've got to get away from
here! We've got to run!

288
00:21:57,088 --> 00:22:00,678
We can't afford to just stand
here forever, don't you see?

289
00:22:22,978 --> 00:22:24,168
Sibylla!

290
00:22:24,478 --> 00:22:26,108
Sibylla!

291
00:22:41,158 --> 00:22:47,798
It is played by my wounds...
the song of prayer.

292
00:22:47,898 --> 00:22:52,028
Let it ring out over
the grieving universe.

293
00:22:52,138 --> 00:22:59,098
Can we change tomorrow?
Don't be afraid.

294
00:22:59,218 --> 00:23:06,778
I want to let you know
how my heart's overflowing.

295
00:23:15,598 --> 00:23:19,588
I want to get closer to you.
I want to feel your pulse.

296
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:24,768
I was too defiant,
and I took the long way around.

297
00:23:24,868 --> 00:23:28,738
The blue moon is swaying silently.

298
00:23:28,838 --> 00:23:32,778
My true heart's desire is you.

299
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:38,648
I can't reach you.
My tears of pain trickle down.

300
00:23:38,748 --> 00:23:44,188
Soar away into the
sky, song of prayer.

301
00:23:44,288 --> 00:23:47,628
Carrying my love that came too late.

302
00:23:47,728 --> 00:23:53,288
What can I do to change tomorrow?

303
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:59,598
Just hold on to "now" the way it is...

304
00:24:04,908 --> 00:24:06,218
To Be Continued

305
00:24:06,218 --> 00:24:06,578
To Be Continued
She was a proud sibylla...

306
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:07,338
She was a proud sibylla...

307
00:24:07,418 --> 00:24:10,978
...not to mention just a young
girl from Simulacrum Kyuukoku.

308
00:24:11,048 --> 00:24:13,348
And now Sibylla Mamina is dead.

309
00:24:14,088 --> 00:24:15,388
Next time on Simoun...

310
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:16,328
Lament

311
00:24:16,328 --> 00:24:17,758
Lament
Lament.

312
00:24:17,758 --> 00:24:19,888
Lament
