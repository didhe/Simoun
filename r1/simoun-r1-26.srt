1
00:00:00,942 --> 00:00:09,942
The countless flowers,
enveloped in light...

2
00:00:10,052 --> 00:00:20,552
...gaze at tomorrow
with unwavering eyes.

3
00:00:32,542 --> 00:00:39,212
Everyone wishes for me to be pure...

4
00:00:39,812 --> 00:00:46,912
...but what can I bring
with me to the frayed skies?

5
00:00:47,022 --> 00:00:54,092
What I've made my own
by breaking off flowers in bloom...

6
00:00:54,402 --> 00:00:59,662
All such sinful things...

7
00:00:59,772 --> 00:01:07,142
Why did I stop making
promises with the future?

8
00:01:07,242 --> 00:01:14,412
Because even if I try
to run far from all the pain...

9
00:01:14,522 --> 00:01:21,152
...a cold wind rustles
my hair... Don't you see?

10
00:01:21,262 --> 00:01:28,662
Where can I ever find the answer?

11
00:01:53,922 --> 00:01:54,912
Rimone...

12
00:01:58,392 --> 00:02:00,522
Rimone, the elder is summoning you.

13
00:02:01,402 --> 00:02:04,302
Aira and Hanna are going
to give it a try today!

14
00:02:25,122 --> 00:02:27,422
Ah, here she is now.

15
00:02:33,132 --> 00:02:34,152
Rimone!

16
00:02:35,362 --> 00:02:37,562
Aira, Hanna...

17
00:02:38,232 --> 00:02:39,302
Are you really sure you want to do this?

18
00:02:39,302 --> 00:02:40,632
Are you really sure you want to do this?
Of course!

19
00:02:40,732 --> 00:02:43,732
You know how long we've been
practicing towards this day!

20
00:02:43,802 --> 00:02:45,572
I'm so glad they chose me!

21
00:02:45,872 --> 00:02:50,312
It's always been my dream to
be like you and Dominüra...

22
00:02:50,782 --> 00:02:53,212
...and to do the Emerald Ri Majon!

23
00:02:54,282 --> 00:02:57,882
Sibylla Dominüra and Sibylla Rimone...

24
00:02:58,222 --> 00:03:03,682
It was they who bestowed us
with the Emerald Ri Majon.

25
00:03:04,432 --> 00:03:07,192
And now our young girls
have taken to the skies.

26
00:03:08,002 --> 00:03:10,592
We have seen flowers blooming
that had never bloomed before...

27
00:03:10,662 --> 00:03:13,932
...and we are now reaping the
harvest of our barren crops.

28
00:03:14,172 --> 00:03:18,202
And now today, we shall
send off two more girls.

29
00:03:18,372 --> 00:03:22,932
I am certain that they, too,
shall bring us great fortune!

30
00:03:45,502 --> 00:03:51,462
Their Portraits

31
00:04:00,652 --> 00:04:04,672
Get a move on! Let's not keep
the client waiting forever!

32
00:04:06,592 --> 00:04:07,822
Morinas...

33
00:04:08,262 --> 00:04:09,882
Well, what is it, Wauf?

34
00:04:10,362 --> 00:04:11,522
Listen to me.

35
00:04:11,592 --> 00:04:14,222
It doesn't matter if
you're a man or a woman...

36
00:04:14,332 --> 00:04:16,892
...or even a former sibylla,
for that matter.

37
00:04:17,002 --> 00:04:20,872
You work for me now! And I'm
not cutting you any slack.

38
00:04:20,972 --> 00:04:23,102
Right, right, so what's up?

39
00:04:23,272 --> 00:04:25,802
Are you telling me to pick up the pace?

40
00:04:26,372 --> 00:04:28,672
You need to go easy on yourself.

41
00:04:29,382 --> 00:04:30,242
Daddy!

42
00:04:30,412 --> 00:04:31,512
Hey, what is it, sweetheart?

43
00:04:31,512 --> 00:04:33,412
Hey, what is it, sweetheart?
Mommy said...

44
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:35,912
...to ask you what you wanted for lunch.

45
00:04:36,022 --> 00:04:39,472
Well, everything your
mommy makes is so delicious.

46
00:04:39,552 --> 00:04:41,892
She said you're not
allowed to say "anything"!

47
00:04:42,022 --> 00:04:44,752
She did? All right, that's
going to be a tough one then.

48
00:04:49,462 --> 00:04:52,632
So listen, this is the
most critical time for you!

49
00:04:52,932 --> 00:04:55,992
I don't want Waporif coming
after me if you overdo it.

50
00:04:56,202 --> 00:05:00,372
I've heard that if you just keep moving,
you can pop out the baby, 1-2-3!

51
00:05:00,442 --> 00:05:01,742
Is that right?

52
00:05:03,682 --> 00:05:04,582
But thanks.

53
00:05:04,652 --> 00:05:07,642
So what are we having for lunch, Daddy?

54
00:05:07,712 --> 00:05:10,442
Hm, let's see now...

55
00:05:12,622 --> 00:05:13,752
Morinas!

56
00:05:13,822 --> 00:05:15,152
Hey, good work.

57
00:05:15,392 --> 00:05:18,552
Hold on a second, didn't you
just finish your night shift?

58
00:05:18,632 --> 00:05:20,022
Well, we don't have a choice.

59
00:05:20,092 --> 00:05:23,222
The highlands and Shoukoku
are already waging a cold war.

60
00:05:23,702 --> 00:05:28,032
They could void the peace treaty any
day, and then they'll drag us into it!

61
00:05:28,772 --> 00:05:30,742
War again, huh?

62
00:05:31,112 --> 00:05:32,442
Eliph! Let's go!

63
00:05:32,512 --> 00:05:33,472
Okay!

64
00:05:33,942 --> 00:05:34,462
See you!

65
00:05:59,772 --> 00:06:01,792
They saved us back there, didn't they?

66
00:06:02,102 --> 00:06:03,162
Yes, they did.

67
00:06:03,902 --> 00:06:05,342
Floe was crying.

68
00:06:06,042 --> 00:06:06,942
I know.

69
00:06:08,012 --> 00:06:09,502
Do you think we'll succeed?

70
00:06:10,182 --> 00:06:11,512
The Emerald Ri Majon?

71
00:06:13,282 --> 00:06:14,182
Yes.

72
00:06:27,492 --> 00:06:30,552
You've stolen a Simoun and
allowed the sibyllae to escape.

73
00:06:30,832 --> 00:06:33,532
Do you realize the magnitude
of what you've done?

74
00:06:33,632 --> 00:06:36,732
Foreign

75
00:06:36,972 --> 00:06:39,912
If they should revolt
against our country...

76
00:06:39,972 --> 00:06:42,412
You've got the wrong idea.
All they're going to do...

77
00:06:42,682 --> 00:06:45,202
...is carry themselves away.

78
00:06:46,182 --> 00:06:47,812
To the Land of Hope.

79
00:07:03,962 --> 00:07:04,992
Paraietta!

80
00:07:05,072 --> 00:07:06,732
Play with us!

81
00:07:07,572 --> 00:07:10,232
I have a guest to tend to now, so
it'll have to be a little later.

82
00:07:10,742 --> 00:07:12,042
Everyone, try to get along now!

83
00:07:12,042 --> 00:07:12,672
Everyone, try to get along now!
Yes, ma'am!

84
00:07:12,672 --> 00:07:15,302
Yes, ma'am!

85
00:07:17,512 --> 00:07:19,142
Such lively children!

86
00:07:19,212 --> 00:07:21,652
I know. It's all I can
do to keep up with them.

87
00:07:22,022 --> 00:07:24,582
Paraietta, I'm so sorry.

88
00:07:24,952 --> 00:07:27,082
I tried to negotiate with them, but...

89
00:07:27,192 --> 00:07:28,552
...there's not much more I can do.

90
00:07:28,622 --> 00:07:30,022
Roatreamon...

91
00:07:30,522 --> 00:07:33,052
...this place wouldn't even
exist without your help.

92
00:07:33,132 --> 00:07:34,622
And I'm so grateful for that.

93
00:07:34,762 --> 00:07:38,162
Well, there has to be
another way. I'll find one.

94
00:07:38,272 --> 00:07:40,632
Once war is officially declared...

95
00:07:40,832 --> 00:07:44,602
...there will be more and more
victims like these children.

96
00:07:45,842 --> 00:07:48,142
They're not really victims though.

97
00:07:48,712 --> 00:07:51,372
Right. They've lost a
lot because of the war...

98
00:07:51,652 --> 00:07:55,142
...but they still have
so much to live for!

99
00:07:55,452 --> 00:07:57,422
They're our seeds of hope.

100
00:07:58,222 --> 00:08:02,382
Their footsteps will one day
ring out across the Land of Hope.

101
00:08:02,862 --> 00:08:04,222
Of Hope...

102
00:08:11,902 --> 00:08:13,632
"The Land of Hope."

103
00:08:14,472 --> 00:08:17,232
For someone who was once
a priestess long ago...

104
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:19,932
...those words have
such a nostalgic ring.

105
00:08:20,342 --> 00:08:22,972
I thought it was only a legend.

106
00:08:24,242 --> 00:08:26,212
Foreign

107
00:08:26,282 --> 00:08:30,112
But even if the legend is true...

108
00:08:30,282 --> 00:08:31,722
Foreign

109
00:08:31,792 --> 00:08:36,382
...what purpose could there be in
performing the Emerald Ri Majon now?

110
00:08:36,762 --> 00:08:40,962
There's no longer any
value to the word "purpose."

111
00:08:41,232 --> 00:08:42,592
Anubituf...

112
00:08:43,502 --> 00:08:47,302
Yes, if we looked hard enough,
we might find such a purpose.

113
00:08:47,502 --> 00:08:50,132
But even if we'd found one...

114
00:08:50,672 --> 00:08:53,402
...the girls would never
have chosen it themselves.

115
00:08:55,482 --> 00:08:56,972
Foreign

116
00:08:58,112 --> 00:08:59,312
What?

117
00:08:59,612 --> 00:09:00,712
The Simouns...

118
00:09:02,722 --> 00:09:06,812
Take our Simouns and pursue
the Sibylla Aurea's Simoun!

119
00:09:07,022 --> 00:09:10,052
Are you insane? Do you
intend to shoot them down?

120
00:09:35,122 --> 00:09:36,052
Chief!

121
00:09:36,452 --> 00:09:40,252
Our hands are tied. There's
nothing we can do now.

122
00:09:41,192 --> 00:09:43,092
We're going to go back to our jobs now!

123
00:09:43,162 --> 00:09:44,122
Yes, sir!

124
00:09:51,932 --> 00:09:53,732
It will be all right, Floe.

125
00:09:53,972 --> 00:09:55,462
They'll be fine.

126
00:09:55,602 --> 00:09:57,302
Even if they go after them now...

127
00:09:57,302 --> 00:09:59,032
Even if they go after them now...
But, but...

128
00:10:00,372 --> 00:10:03,172
I'm sure that Aer and
Neviril will make it in time.

129
00:10:04,112 --> 00:10:05,412
It's going to be all right.

130
00:10:05,882 --> 00:10:07,472
Here, your nose is running!

131
00:10:09,452 --> 00:10:12,942
Really, since when are
you such a crybaby, Floe?

132
00:10:13,022 --> 00:10:15,042
But, but...

133
00:10:15,492 --> 00:10:17,962
Floe, there's no need to worry.

134
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:19,292
Don't cry.

135
00:10:19,362 --> 00:10:22,562
Yeah, come on. I'm
sure Aer and Neviril...

136
00:10:23,002 --> 00:10:24,192
Huh? What?

137
00:10:24,262 --> 00:10:25,502
Para-sama, you're breathing on me...

138
00:10:25,502 --> 00:10:26,802
Para-sama, you're breathing on me...
What? Oh no!

139
00:10:26,872 --> 00:10:29,232
Okay! I'm gonna get
all touchy-feely too!

140
00:10:29,372 --> 00:10:31,502
Oh? Then let's do that too!

141
00:10:31,642 --> 00:10:32,812
Para-sama!

142
00:10:32,812 --> 00:10:33,272
Para-sama!
Me too!

143
00:10:33,272 --> 00:10:33,312
Me too!

144
00:10:33,312 --> 00:10:34,782
Come on! Stop it, Alty!
Me, too!

145
00:10:34,782 --> 00:10:35,762
Come on! Stop it, Alty!

146
00:10:54,432 --> 00:10:56,262
Big Sister, was that...

147
00:10:57,332 --> 00:10:58,262
Yes.

148
00:11:03,542 --> 00:11:05,002
Big Sister! Hurry, hurry!

149
00:11:05,572 --> 00:11:07,872
Dad's clothes! Alty! Get that one!

150
00:11:08,912 --> 00:11:12,352
Oh, brother. All that time
we spent doing laundry...

151
00:11:12,412 --> 00:11:15,382
This weather's so weird. Guess we'll
just have to wash everything again.

152
00:11:15,452 --> 00:11:18,352
Hey, all you do is sit
there and watch, Big Sister!

153
00:11:18,452 --> 00:11:20,322
Well, that's my job.

154
00:11:20,392 --> 00:11:21,912
Dummy!

155
00:11:49,922 --> 00:11:51,142
Dominüra...

156
00:12:12,072 --> 00:12:13,872
Are you feeling any better?

157
00:12:15,842 --> 00:12:18,682
Thank you. My fever has gone down.

158
00:12:18,752 --> 00:12:20,042
That's good.

159
00:12:20,652 --> 00:12:22,142
Is something the matter?

160
00:12:22,282 --> 00:12:24,312
I think I finally understand...

161
00:12:25,152 --> 00:12:27,482
...what you meant after all this time.

162
00:12:28,692 --> 00:12:30,882
They're all going to fly off.

163
00:12:31,892 --> 00:12:34,522
Into a sky where nothing
is ever certain...

164
00:12:35,032 --> 00:12:37,902
Towards a hope that they
can't even be sure exists.

165
00:12:38,532 --> 00:12:41,732
I made everyone learn how
to do the Emerald Ri Majon...

166
00:12:42,142 --> 00:12:44,402
...yet I don't even
take to the skies myself.

167
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:45,942
I...

168
00:12:47,572 --> 00:12:48,542
Rimone...

169
00:12:49,382 --> 00:12:50,782
Do you want to fly again?

170
00:12:51,512 --> 00:12:52,572
Yes.

171
00:12:52,852 --> 00:12:55,712
But if you don't want
to do it, Dominüra...

172
00:12:57,152 --> 00:12:59,022
I'll never fly with anyone as my pair...

173
00:12:59,692 --> 00:13:01,652
...but you, Dominüra.

174
00:13:11,932 --> 00:13:15,892
I'm going to do it for you.

175
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:21,772
The Emerald Ri Majon.

176
00:13:23,982 --> 00:13:25,172
Simouns!

177
00:13:25,612 --> 00:13:27,312
They're coming after us!

178
00:13:27,752 --> 00:13:28,552
Neviril!

179
00:13:28,552 --> 00:13:29,342
Neviril!
Yes.

180
00:13:29,622 --> 00:13:31,212
Let's hurry! They're
going to catch up to us.

181
00:13:31,282 --> 00:13:32,152
Wait.

182
00:13:32,252 --> 00:13:32,742
What?

183
00:13:35,892 --> 00:13:37,722
They're going to do a Ri Majon!

184
00:13:37,862 --> 00:13:39,022
We'd better hurry up then!

185
00:13:39,092 --> 00:13:41,192
No. That's...

186
00:13:43,032 --> 00:13:44,432
What is it?

187
00:13:44,832 --> 00:13:46,562
I've never seen that Ri Majon before.

188
00:13:47,002 --> 00:13:48,972
The Morning Calm Ri Majon.

189
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:51,632
Morning Calm?

190
00:13:52,712 --> 00:13:54,872
I read about that one
once in an old book.

191
00:13:55,512 --> 00:13:58,032
It's performed to bid farewell to
comrades about to depart on a journey.

192
00:13:58,652 --> 00:14:01,272
To bid farewell to comrades
departing on a journey...

193
00:14:11,792 --> 00:14:12,852
But that's...

194
00:14:13,592 --> 00:14:15,032
The Morning Calm Ri Majon?

195
00:14:18,572 --> 00:14:21,262
Foreign

196
00:14:22,902 --> 00:14:26,002
There was also a time in my life...

197
00:14:26,572 --> 00:14:29,012
Foreign

198
00:14:29,142 --> 00:14:31,542
Long ago, we were all maidens too.

199
00:14:54,672 --> 00:14:55,692
Let's do it.

200
00:14:55,842 --> 00:14:56,672
Yes.

201
00:14:57,302 --> 00:14:58,272
Let's do it now.

202
00:15:07,982 --> 00:15:09,612
Let's go now, Aer...

203
00:15:10,152 --> 00:15:12,082
To a place where you and I can be free!

204
00:15:13,222 --> 00:15:16,022
Yes. Let's go, Neviril!

205
00:15:25,172 --> 00:15:27,362
Forgive me for bringing
you here, Rimone.

206
00:15:27,432 --> 00:15:29,532
That's all right. What is it?

207
00:15:30,072 --> 00:15:33,272
You see, I want you to pair up with me.

208
00:15:35,012 --> 00:15:37,412
I already told you no once.

209
00:15:37,542 --> 00:15:38,772
I'll only...

210
00:15:38,952 --> 00:15:40,282
I know that.

211
00:15:40,682 --> 00:15:46,712
But does Dominüra ever intend
to fly again? I wonder...

212
00:15:52,032 --> 00:15:53,152
I'm sorry.

213
00:15:53,562 --> 00:15:54,532
Still...

214
00:16:12,082 --> 00:16:14,272
Um, wasn't that a Simoun?

215
00:16:14,882 --> 00:16:15,852
Aer!

216
00:16:15,922 --> 00:16:17,882
Huh? What's that?

217
00:16:18,252 --> 00:16:19,512
Is that a name?

218
00:16:19,592 --> 00:16:22,452
The ultimate form of love.

219
00:16:24,562 --> 00:16:25,492
Love?

220
00:16:25,732 --> 00:16:26,922
That's right.

221
00:16:28,702 --> 00:16:29,892
Dominüra!

222
00:16:30,262 --> 00:16:32,602
The ultimate love.

223
00:16:33,302 --> 00:16:35,672
Which sky shall we journey towards next?

224
00:16:36,942 --> 00:16:38,162
Dominüra!

225
00:17:09,342 --> 00:17:11,432
Hey! You got here early, Vura!

226
00:17:12,142 --> 00:17:13,972
No, wait. I mean Vuraf.

227
00:17:14,072 --> 00:17:15,542
It's awkward for you
to call me that, right?

228
00:17:15,782 --> 00:17:16,902
You can just call me Vura.

229
00:17:16,982 --> 00:17:19,772
All right, Vura. Why
don't you come inside?

230
00:17:19,952 --> 00:17:20,672
Sure.

231
00:17:26,252 --> 00:17:27,552
Did you get one too, Vura?

232
00:17:27,852 --> 00:17:28,752
Yeah.

233
00:17:29,092 --> 00:17:31,682
The war hasn't even started yet!

234
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,462
I guess former sibyllae...

235
00:17:33,532 --> 00:17:36,932
...have the honor of being the first
to be shipped out at times like these.

236
00:17:37,002 --> 00:17:38,162
Which side?

237
00:17:38,532 --> 00:17:41,502
My hometown is on the
other side of the border.

238
00:17:41,972 --> 00:17:43,372
I'll be fighting for Shoukoku.

239
00:17:44,542 --> 00:17:46,202
So we're going to be enemies then?

240
00:17:46,372 --> 00:17:47,272
Yeah.

241
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:52,642
Never mind. Here, have some of our
local vegetables! New strain, you know.

242
00:17:52,982 --> 00:17:54,782
I need to make a killing on these...

243
00:17:55,112 --> 00:17:59,072
...and find myself a lovely bride.
I can't die till I've done that!

244
00:18:00,052 --> 00:18:03,452
Becoming a man hasn't
changed you at all, Floef!

245
00:18:03,922 --> 00:18:06,652
It's hard to say, isn't it?
You can just call me Floe too.

246
00:18:15,572 --> 00:18:17,262
Is that the Arcus Prima?

247
00:18:17,772 --> 00:18:21,762
Yeah. I thought I might as well
live where I can always see it.

248
00:18:21,912 --> 00:18:23,212
That's why I picked this spot.

249
00:18:23,282 --> 00:18:25,442
A sunken luxury liner?

250
00:18:26,452 --> 00:18:28,142
I suppose there's an allure to that.

251
00:18:29,382 --> 00:18:30,142
See you then.

252
00:18:30,222 --> 00:18:31,212
Yeah, see you later.

253
00:18:31,682 --> 00:18:33,682
Wait, that might be bad luck to say.

254
00:18:34,022 --> 00:18:36,392
I don't want to see
you on the battlefield.

255
00:18:37,462 --> 00:18:39,722
All right then. How's goodbye?

256
00:18:39,832 --> 00:18:42,122
Right. Goodbye.

257
00:18:42,232 --> 00:18:43,222
Bye.

258
00:19:05,292 --> 00:19:10,122
I wonder why none of us could let it go?

259
00:19:10,992 --> 00:19:14,862
The idea of sending Aer and
Neviril off to that other world?

260
00:19:15,162 --> 00:19:20,862
Was it because we wanted to defy
the inescapable flow of time?

261
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:23,132
We were afraid to grow up.

262
00:19:23,502 --> 00:19:25,272
We wanted to stay the way
we were as young girls.

263
00:19:25,742 --> 00:19:28,872
Did we project those feelings
on to Aer and Neviril?

264
00:19:29,682 --> 00:19:31,772
No, I'm sure that's not it.

265
00:19:32,312 --> 00:19:35,282
All we wanted to do
was to leave our mark.

266
00:19:36,082 --> 00:19:39,522
To prove that we once
existed, right here.

267
00:19:40,352 --> 00:19:42,292
We wanted to shout that
out to the whole world.

268
00:19:43,762 --> 00:19:47,692
The fact that we were
once really here...

269
00:19:48,932 --> 00:19:50,562
We wanted to leave our mark.

270
00:19:51,562 --> 00:19:53,362
We wanted to raise our voices.

271
00:20:02,442 --> 00:20:03,642
Aer...

272
00:20:03,982 --> 00:20:05,242
Neviril...

273
00:20:05,482 --> 00:20:08,972
I wonder where you are right now?

274
00:20:14,222 --> 00:20:17,522
Where are you, our eternal maidens?

275
00:20:32,172 --> 00:20:33,872
Such a nice breeze.

276
00:20:34,042 --> 00:20:35,232
Yes.

277
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:37,202
It certainly is a nice breeze.

278
00:22:41,472 --> 00:22:48,102
It is played by my wounds...
the song of prayer.

279
00:22:48,212 --> 00:22:52,342
Let it ring out over
the grieving universe.

280
00:22:52,452 --> 00:22:59,412
Can we change tomorrow?
Don't be afraid.

281
00:22:59,522 --> 00:23:07,092
I want to let you know
how my heart's overflowing.

282
00:23:15,902 --> 00:23:19,902
I want to get closer to you.
I want to feel your pulse.

283
00:23:20,012 --> 00:23:25,072
I was too defiant,
and I took the long way around.

284
00:23:25,182 --> 00:23:29,052
The blue moon is swaying silently.

285
00:23:29,152 --> 00:23:33,082
My true heart's desire is you.

286
00:23:33,192 --> 00:23:38,952
I can't reach you.
My tears of pain trickle down.

287
00:23:39,062 --> 00:23:44,502
Soar away into the sky, song of prayer.

288
00:23:44,602 --> 00:23:47,932
Carrying my love that came too late.

289
00:23:48,032 --> 00:23:53,602
What can I do to change tomorrow?

290
00:23:53,712 --> 00:23:59,912
Just hold on to "now" the way it is...
