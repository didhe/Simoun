1
00:00:01,601 --> 00:00:04,570
Looks like we have 3 guests today.

2
00:00:04,938 --> 00:00:06,565
No, that's 4 guests.

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,274
Meaning I'm a guest too?

4
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:11,266
Meaning I'm a guest too?
Please call out the title of this show!

<i>Monthly! ADR Bulletin Special</i>

9
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,878
Hello! I'm Mikako Takahashi,
and I play Roatreamon.

10
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,157
Yay!

11
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,090
How do you do. I'm Rika Morinaga,
the voice of Mamina.

12
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:30,129
Yo!

13
00:00:31,264 --> 00:00:34,028
Hello. I'm Kaori Natsuka,
and I play Yun.

14
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,067
Hey!

15
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:38,928
It felt like we pretty much
had to do that or else, right?

16
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:39,994
Pretty much.

17
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:41,938
Not only that, but since
you were the third one...

18
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:43,976
...you had to be the grand finale!

19
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,239
Sorry, I wasn't much
of a grand finale.

20
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:50,782
With three guests instead of two,
it's pretty boisterous, isn't it?

21
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,308
Well, you're a lot more
boisterous than they are.

22
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:56,655
What did you say?

23
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:58,247
Three, two...

24
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:04,752
Simoun OX (TruelFalse) Talk!

25
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:06,366
All right.

26
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:06,699
All right.
Yes?

27
00:01:06,699 --> 00:01:06,733
Yes?

28
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:07,367
Time for the Simoun OX Quiz.
Yes?

29
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:09,767
Time for the Simoun OX Quiz.

30
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:10,236
Okay.

31
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:10,770
Okay.
That's what we're going to do.

32
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:11,498
That's what we're going to do.

33
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,471
Right, and it's self-explanatory.

34
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:14,871
Good job!

35
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:16,203
Really? Thanks.

36
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:17,243
Good.

37
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:18,278
Now then...

38
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:18,778
Now then...
Okay!

39
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:18,812
Okay!

40
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:19,646
...shall we begin?
Okay!

41
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:19,679
...shall we begin?

42
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:20,080
...shall we begin?
Yeah.

43
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,113
Yeah.

44
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:20,780
Right. Here's the question!
Yeah.

45
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,213
Right. Here's the question!

46
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:27,543
<i>You've changed somehow,</i>
<i>playing your current character...</i>

47
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,917
Ready, set...

48
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:29,955
True!

49
00:01:30,056 --> 00:01:30,681
Huh?

50
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:33,317
What?

51
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:33,626
False?

52
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:34,991
False?
Huh?

53
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:37,256
What? I put up true.

54
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:39,694
I feel that compared
to myself today...

55
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:43,258
...I was much closer to
Roatreamon when I was younger.

56
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:45,497
It's not so much that I've changed,
but that I came to realize...

57
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:48,234
...that I might have been
more like her back then.

58
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:51,505
So I think, "You've
got to grow up!"...

59
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:54,877
...whenever I look at Roatreamon
more and more these days.

60
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,178
In my case, the reason
why I put up an X...

61
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,945
...is because Yun
really hates war.

62
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:01,452
And I've felt that
way for a long time.

63
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:04,888
"It would be best not to have
to go into battle at all."

64
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,791
That way of thinking hasn't
really changed for me.

65
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:09,726
So I can really relate to her.

66
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:13,630
It's not that I think, "I see..."
when Yun expresses her views...

67
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,294
...it's more like, "That's right."

68
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:19,770
So I feel that I can say my
lines straight from the heart.

69
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,129
I see.

70
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:22,509
How about you, Rika?

71
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:23,999
How about you, Rika?
Nothing's changed at all.

72
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:25,439
I mean...

73
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:27,946
...I have the same kind
of personality as Mamina!

74
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:29,115
Really?

75
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:29,706
Really?
Yeah.

76
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:30,817
You mean like being mischievous?

77
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:31,374
You mean like being mischievous?
Yeah.

78
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:32,552
That's you being mischievous?

79
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:33,319
That's you being mischievous?
I don't know if it's really mischief...

80
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,251
I don't know if it's really mischief...

81
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,448
...but you know, like
playing little jokes.

82
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:38,354
Mamina-jokes?

83
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:40,392
Right, like playing Mamina-jokes.

84
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:44,191
Also, like when things aren't clear,
she turns around and explodes on you.

85
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:45,458
"Come on, you!" Like that.

86
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:47,898
You're right, Mamina's
the type who...

87
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:50,231
She always seems to be
crackling with emotion.

88
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:51,861
That's how she's
depicted in the show.

89
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:54,168
Mamina is the most
temperamental, don't you think?

90
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,832
She's a lot like Aer in that way...

91
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:57,399
Wait, you're probably right!

92
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:58,578
Yes, she does seem to be.

93
00:02:58,578 --> 00:02:59,602
Yes, she does seem to be.
Right.

94
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,047
I'm convinced.

95
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:01,843
I'm convinced.
Yep.

96
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:05,179
All right, let's move on to
the next question. Drum roll...

97
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:07,719
<i>You're 17 and you</i>
<i>must go to the Spring.</i>

98
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:10,255
<i>Would you choose to</i>
<i>become female after all?</i>

99
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:11,551
Ready, set...

100
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:12,648
True!

101
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,389
This is interesting!

102
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:17,063
We're split...

103
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:18,121
We're split...
This is interesting.

104
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:20,465
An X for you, Rika!
You're the only one.

105
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,195
I just want to see what it's like.

106
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:26,500
I mean, you can't go around
hitting on people if you're a girl.

107
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:27,972
But if you're a guy...

108
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,372
You want to hit on girls?

109
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:30,643
Don't you?

110
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:31,632
Don't you?
But why?

111
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,372
I don't want to hit on girls!

112
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:37,644
Come on, I want to go to the beach
and ask girls out like they do!

113
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:38,979
What the...

114
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,384
Why? Don't you mean you
want to be asked out?

115
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:44,548
No, I want to go up to an
easy-Iooking girl and pick her up!

116
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:46,148
Wouldn't that be awesome?

117
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,387
I mean, if you get
hit on like that...

118
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:50,725
...what do you do? Just bare
your fangs at the guy, right?

119
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:54,255
So I always wonder if there are
that many girls who do that...

120
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,165
...and I want to check
it out for myself.

121
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,303
You mean, girls who'd fall for your bait.

122
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:58,463
You mean, girls who'd fall for your bait.
Right, right.

123
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:01,507
How many girls are there who'd
actually be like, "Ah, sure"?

124
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:02,208
You think there's that many?

125
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,108
You think there's that many?
I don't really want to check that out.

126
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:08,073
Question: Do you want me as your pair?

127
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,349
Hey, wait till I'm finished
asking the question!

128
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:16,446
Why, Oh Why!? Simoun.

129
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:18,420
All right!

130
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:19,458
All right then!

131
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:20,924
There's just too many of these...

132
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:22,757
...special, hard-to-memorize
Simoun terms.

133
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:25,229
So in this corner we're going to
try to refresh everyone's memory!

134
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:28,096
All right, Simoun-sama. If you please!

135
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:32,101
What in the world
is a helical motor?

136
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:33,069
Helical motor...

137
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:36,575
Helical motor is the one we always
disagree on where to put the accent.

138
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:37,507
Hey, that's right.

139
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:41,343
Is it helical MOtor
or is it helical moTOR?

140
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:43,405
And helical MOtor is the
correct way to say it?

141
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:44,450
Correct.

142
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:46,110
I think we just
reviewed the wrong thing.

143
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:46,708
Yeah, that wasn't it.

144
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,686
Yeah, that wasn't it.
We need to go over its meaning.

145
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:49,414
Its meaning...

146
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:50,114
Its meaning...

147
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:50,746
Meaning...

148
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:51,687
Meaning...

149
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:55,588
We have no idea, do we?

150
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:58,462
It's hard to actually
define something like that...

151
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:00,624
Isn't it like... the engine?

152
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,860
Engine?

153
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:03,060
The vehicle of the gods?

154
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:03,536
Um...

155
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:04,366
Um...
Vehicle of the gods?

156
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:07,201
It's part of the vehicle. Somewhere.

157
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:09,070
You mean the swirly thing?

158
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:09,972
The swirl...

159
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,067
That's not it?

160
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:14,075
Oh well, that's close enough.

161
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,513
<i>What is the Helical Motor?</i>
<i>"An ancient system developed...</i>

162
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:19,244
<i>...in order to utilize the power</i>
<i>of the deity Tempus Spatium."</i>

163
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,583
Even if you read the answer,
it doesn't really register.

164
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:22,643
It doesn't register at all for me!

165
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:24,485
And we've already been
through a lot of ADR sessions!

166
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:27,025
Oh, but I still haven't
uttered that line once yet.

167
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:28,082
Well, I've said it.

168
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:28,786
Really?

169
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:32,353
But I really, really
don't get it! I never have!

170
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,423
I'm just saying
whatever the script says!

171
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,263
The truth comes out!
You just confessed!

172
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,395
I've never had much to
do with all that, see.

173
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:41,429
The power of...

174
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,974
It's a system?

175
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:45,840
Meaning it's a system that
was built by somebody, right?

176
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:47,539
Long, long ago...

177
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:51,179
Oh, so it's like an Intel chip or
something? I mean, what do I know?

178
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,080
Am I wrong?

179
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:55,484
Well, I guess you could
say the nuance is the same.

180
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:56,956
Ah...

181
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:57,684
Ah...
I see...

182
00:05:57,757 --> 00:05:59,058
This one was a little hard to answer.

183
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:00,753
This one was a little hard to answer.
It was a hard question, wasn't it?

184
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,960
Are all the questions
going to be this difficult?

185
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:04,161
We're in for it...

186
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,026
I know...

187
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:06,930
Makes you nervous about
the next one, doesn't it?

188
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:08,193
What, you mean that's it?

189
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:09,466
Is it all right to
end it like this?

190
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:12,003
It seems all right. So we're
going to end this corner now.

191
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:16,064
So anyway, that's it for today.
Why, Oh Why!? Simoun.

192
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:22,978
Now then, time to
announce a Simoun product.

193
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:26,685
All right, time for a
product announcement.

194
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,516
You won't believe this, but...

195
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:34,025
...a Simoun game will be
coming out on the Playstation 2!

196
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:35,583
Game, game!

197
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:37,363
Game, game!

198
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:38,022
Game, game!
Game, game!

199
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:39,689
So tell us, what kind of
game is it going to be?

200
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:40,926
Right, the title is...

201
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,491
...Simoun: Battle of Thorns
- Seal by Ri M_a_jon.

202
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:44,763
It's a bit...

203
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:45,667
That's the title.

204
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:46,372
Sounds fierce.

205
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:47,805
Sounds fierce.
Yes, for some reason it sounds fierce.

206
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:50,468
I've never even heard
of "sealing by Ri M_a_jon"!

207
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:51,310
I know!

208
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,368
I know!
Uh...

209
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:54,640
"The recording process
is on a marvelous roll!"

210
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:55,915
That's what it says here.

211
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:56,609
That's what it says here.
Right.

212
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:58,047
Is the recording going well?

213
00:06:58,117 --> 00:07:00,142
Oh, sure! I'm at the top of my game!

214
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:01,921
It's going well for us too, right?

215
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:02,819
It's going well for us too, right?
Yeah!

216
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:08,390
So anyway, we hope you're
looking forward to...

217
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:10,929
...the release of this new
Simoun Playstation 2 game!

218
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:14,099
Working with you has worn me out.

219
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:16,935
Those are my lines!

220
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,837
All right then...
Good job, everyone!

221
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:21,533
Good job!

222
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,235
So what did you think?

223
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:23,709
Mmm...

224
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:24,368
Mmm...
Kaori?

225
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,570
What, me?

226
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:27,568
I really caught you off guard!

227
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:29,046
Yeah, you did!

228
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,445
Well, we were told we could
start off in a laid-back way...

229
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:34,486
...but now I'm worried if
they can even use this...

230
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:35,612
I know. I'm really worried too.

231
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:39,624
For the most part, all we really
did was chat about stuff, right?

232
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:43,150
Yes. I think the editors have
their work cut out for them!

233
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:45,629
It was like we were
broadcasting the fact that...

234
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:47,467
...we had no knowledge of Simoun!

235
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,835
...we had no knowledge of Simoun!
We came off like Simoun newbies!

236
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:49,824
We came off like Simoun newbies!

237
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:52,370
Even though the three of us
have already done a lot of ADR.

238
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:56,135
So we should have a lot more
advance knowledge than everyone else!

239
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:59,770
But we ended up making a
lot of clueless comments!

240
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,408
But let's not dwell on that!

241
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,914
It was laid-back...

242
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:03,249
Yeah, it was a lot of fun!

243
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:04,876
Yeah, it was a lot of fun!
Let's do a good job recording!

244
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:06,816
Oh, right, the ADR.
Let's do our best!

245
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:07,648
Right!

246
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,984
So, anyway, there are still a lot
of Simoun episodes coming up...

247
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:12,490
...so please keep watching Simoun!

248
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:13,525
Please continue to watch!

249
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:17,859
<i>Don't miss the next episode!!</i>
