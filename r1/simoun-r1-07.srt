1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:09,730
The countless flowers,
enveloped in light...

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:20,440
...gaze at tomorrow
with unwavering eyes.

3
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:39,330
Everyone wishes for me to be pure...

4
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:46,730
...but what can I bring
with me to the frayed skies?

5
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:53,910
What I've made my own
by breaking off flowers in bloom...

6
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:59,480
All such sinful things...

7
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:06,930
Why did I stop making
promises with the future?

8
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:14,230
Because even if I try
to run far from all the pain...

9
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,830
...a cold wind rustles
my hair... Don't you see?

10
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:28,140
Where can I ever find the answer?

11
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,820
Making another unauthorized
flight, Chor Tempest?

12
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:42,260
Vura!

13
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:48,030
Dux Guragief ordered us to go
on a special training mission.

14
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,300
You're all busy with
regular duties, right?

15
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:56,430
Yeah, we're tired. Night patrol requires
far more vigilance than day patrol.

16
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,980
And enemy encounters are likelier.

17
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,520
It's easier to just float
around during the day.

18
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,720
But your chor used to do
nothing but daytime patrol.

19
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:13,030
The night shift was always our job.

20
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,960
But that's not the case now.

21
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:20,060
The top chor on
Arcus Prima is now us, Rubor.

22
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,040
If you don't like it,
then prove you're still worthy.

23
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,040
Step aside. We're exhausted.

24
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,540
Everyone, let them pass.

25
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,180
By the way, which Ri Majon?

26
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,250
The Dandelion Ri Majon.

27
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,880
Dandelion?

28
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,020
The ceremonial Ri Majon
used for diplomatic purposes.

29
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:50,500
Why use
an old-fashioned Ri Majon like that?

30
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,830
Vura!

31
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,200
Help yourself to
the leftover candy on my desk!

32
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,240
Don't wake me coming back!

33
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:07,200
Over International Waters

34
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,200
Wow!
Look how spotless you are now.

35
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,840
These kids worked hard.

36
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:41,350
It's quite an antique,
so they had a rough time.

37
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,610
Thanks.

38
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:47,380
My grandpa flew this
when he was young.

39
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:50,460
Your grandfather
was a Simoun sibylla too?

40
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:55,860
So after he went to the Spring and
stopped flying, he still treasured this.

41
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:25,250
They're jealous that we always
used to be assigned night patrol.

42
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:30,520
When Chor Rubor used to run into
Neviril, they'd just look on from afar.

43
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,760
Be proud of yourselves.

44
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:39,710
As a member of Chor Tempest, I plan
to take this chor right back to the top.

45
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:45,640
Right. As far as wanting to see
Tempest back on top, I'm with her.

46
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,850
Well, I guess you're right.

47
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:51,910
Since we won't have to go to the
Spring as long as we keep winning?

48
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,510
Well, I can't wait to go.

49
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,320
Then what's stopping you?

50
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:01,460
I want to go with
the person I care about.

51
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,190
Then when I emerge from
the Spring, I'll be a man.

52
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,530
And she'll be a woman...

53
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,630
And you'll consummate
things then and there?

54
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,700
Quiet down.

55
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:16,700
Listen up, everybody.

56
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:21,480
There are two obstacles
to becoming the best chor.

57
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,310
Unless we get two new members...

58
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:27,950
...we won't be able
to fly six Simouns at once.

59
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,850
What's the other thing?

60
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:32,650
Neviril...

61
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:35,460
If Neviril and Aer flew as a pair...

62
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,160
...it wouldn't be a stretch
to see our chor back on top!

63
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,660
Para-sama...

64
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,700
...you're giving up on Neviril?

65
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:51,310
Let's do it in front of the Arcus Prima!
So that the dux and Neviril can see.

66
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,030
Morinas-san, higher!

67
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,260
Am I not good enough
for Sibylla Aurea?

68
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,670
Morinas-san, please concentrate!

69
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:16,070
Okay, okay.

70
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:18,400
You have to lead the others.

71
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,560
Right.

72
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,870
So who's this loved one?

73
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:25,380
Floe, I'm hearing bad
things about you lately.

74
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,710
No way! It's not true, is it, Alty?

75
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,370
Of course it's true.

76
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,080
I'm so happy...

77
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:35,120
Para-sama,
you're responding to my feelings.

78
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,320
What are you talking about?

79
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,890
I was sure you hated me.

80
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,790
Since the other day...

81
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,390
Be specific!

82
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,620
Huh?

83
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,370
Arcus Niger? We're not
supposed to rendezvous till later.

84
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,780
That's the Niger. No mistake.

85
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,480
An emergency, perhaps?

86
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:08,610
I'm sure they're just being
rushed by the higher-ups.

87
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,560
You should summon
the Tempest girls back.

88
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,030
Arcus Niger!

89
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,030
Niger?

90
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,660
They're supposed to be west
of the great temple... Why...

91
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,410
A Simile Simoun!

92
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,110
A messenger?

93
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,480
Even so...

94
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:48,720
How lame is that pilot?
Missing the cable like that!

95
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:51,790
No, they're avoiding it on purpose.

96
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,100
Hey!

97
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,010
Hey!

98
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,530
Talk!

99
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,010
You're supposed to be Chor Tempest?

100
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:01,270
Since the Plumbum highlands and
our nation share similar customs...

101
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:04,960
...I didn't think the decor
here would offend you.

102
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,440
Let's have
Tempus Spatium be scarce.

103
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:12,440
That would undermine
our authority severely...

104
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:15,940
The highlanders worship
a deity named Animus.

105
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,840
Historically speaking...

106
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:22,410
...Animus and Tempus Spatium
are in fact the same god.

107
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:26,190
The highlands and Kyuukoku
do not acknowledge this.

108
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:29,750
It's best to avoid
unnecessary stimulation?

109
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,200
For the sake of peace.

110
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:35,940
Tempus Spatium would
be glad to be concealed.

111
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,500
Peace conference?

112
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:14,430
Right. It's fair to say we're battling
all our neighboring countries.

113
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,980
Each one,
because of economic strife...

114
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,210
They want the Simouns.
No matter what.

115
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,450
Right.

116
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,910
To be more precise,
they're after the helical motors.

117
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:29,720
Unearthed only from ruins,
the wings that give Simouns flight.

118
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:35,650
But now the Plumbum highlands
have come to broker a peace deal.

119
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,630
It's been decided the first conference
will be held in international waters.

120
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,330
In utmost secrecy of course.

121
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,070
So they'll hold this conference
on the Arcus Prima, huh?

122
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:51,510
Who cares about politics?
Are we free to use the maju pool?

123
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,780
I think they'll say not
to act without permission.

124
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,510
Hey, it's them.

125
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,450
The ones flying that Simile before.

126
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:03,520
Why are they
wandering around here?

127
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,360
They're headed this way.

128
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,730
Why are they on our ship?

129
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,600
The most obvious reason is
that they're new members...

130
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:27,950
Hey, I bet she'll say something like,
"Chor Tempest sure is a letdown."

131
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,810
Right, right.

132
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,690
Sorry for earlier,
members of Chor Tempest.

133
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:39,860
So it was you two after all.

134
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,690
Still, you sure are a letdown.

135
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,530
Is it that funny, my lady Roatreamon?

136
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,710
I don't blame you
for not remembering.

137
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,950
I just lived on your estate...

138
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,050
...as the daughter of two
of your many servants.

139
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,140
Come now, Mamina.

140
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:44,060
Mamina?

141
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:49,490
I am honored that
you remember me, my lady.

142
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,600
As of today,
I've been ordered to transfer...

143
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:01,000
...from Arcus Niger's
Chor Ignus to Chor Tempest.

144
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:05,040
I'm Sibylla Mamina. I'm pleased
to make your acquaintance.

145
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:09,780
And I'm Yun.
I'm also joining Chor Tempest.

146
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:14,050
I have one thing to say. I despise war.

147
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,480
That's all.

148
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:22,890
Somebody!
Somebody, please help us!

149
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,020
Sibylla Aurea's room...

150
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,400
What's this about Neviril?

151
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,070
Neviril!

152
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:42,880
Paraietta...

153
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:47,040
What's going on?
What do you think you're doing?

154
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,920
Sibylla Aurea sleeps
alone in her room.

155
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:53,360
That's a privilege
granted to her alone! Hey!

156
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,790
Starting today,
she's sharing her room.

157
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,360
Father!

158
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,120
Para, it's been a while.

159
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:03,530
Yes, it has, Vice Chancellor.

160
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:09,100
Neviril, I think this is a good way to
immediately bond with your new pair.

161
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,240
New pair?

162
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,480
Then that's my bed.

163
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,480
A "new pair"...Father.

164
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,490
Yes, I'm assigning Mamina.

165
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,480
Mamina?

166
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:25,080
Excuse me.

167
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:37,370
Pairs should be formed out of mutual
need and according to the natural flow.

168
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:42,370
You were once a sibylla, Father,
so you should be well aware of that.

169
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,350
Neviril, in this day and age,
it doesn't work that way anymore.

170
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:52,820
You must take this step now
or your name will be tarnished.

171
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:56,410
I was an auriga,
but if I can pair with you...

172
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,010
...I'd be happy to fly as a sagitta.

173
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:05,490
Mamina is not from
a family befitting a sibylla.

174
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:11,000
But of all the great temple's
candidates, she scored the highest.

175
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:14,200
As far as the Wave Crest
and Tsunami Ri Majons...

176
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:16,540
...I can pray better than anyone.

177
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,340
Those are all highly dangerous.

178
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,340
Which enable us to annihilate
more enemies in one blow.

179
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:26,520
All I want is for you to snap out of it.

180
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,710
Granted, a tragedy occurred.

181
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:35,090
But you shall overcome that and
regain your glory as Sibylla Aurea.

182
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:40,160
Meaning that your standing in
the council will be safe, Father?

183
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:44,500
I don't understand what's
going on in your head, Neviril.

184
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:48,610
If you're put off by battle,
then you should go to the Spring.

185
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,510
You'll surely become a lovely woman.

186
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:57,280
But if you're put off by the Spring and
refuse to fly a Simoun, what then?

187
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,610
You're telling me
to give you an answer.

188
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,110
You're old enough now.

189
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,650
Is Neviril coming back?

190
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:10,620
Hey, Aer, you should
pair with me after all.

191
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,690
I like Neviril.

192
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,260
Neviril really is popular.

193
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:21,240
I think I'll give up on her.

194
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,640
What will you do?

195
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:27,870
I'll pair with someone. But even so,
I'll still despise what we do.

196
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,480
If so, then just hurry on to the Spring.

197
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,850
I couldn't do that!

198
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,720
Already, many of my friends,
despite being priestesses...

199
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:43,630
...were sent to the battlefield since
they could fly Simouns and perished.

200
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:47,630
I couldn't run away
from that just on my own!

201
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,400
That reason sounds like a death wish.

202
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:00,910
Paraietta.

203
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:06,280
I always thought you and Neviril
would fly as a pair one day.

204
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:08,120
Vice Chancellor...

205
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:11,190
No matter what, I will protect Neviril.

206
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,500
Mamina, I'm sorry.

207
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,400
I'm still...

208
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:06,180
Sibylla Aurea,
I want you to be my pair...

209
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:08,580
...body and soul.

210
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:15,920
Sibylla Mamina, even if you
take my body by force...

211
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:18,320
...you will never be my pair.

212
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,320
Neviril, try to understand.

213
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:25,660
I've got to pair up with you,
no matter what it takes.

214
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,610
Aer!

215
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:57,330
You actually used that rope
to come through the window?

216
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,820
You're such a funny girl.

217
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:09,110
All six Simouns will be needed
for the Dandelion Ri Majon.

218
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:11,340
As Chor Tempest is now...

219
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,350
We've already bolstered the ranks.
Is that not enough?

220
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,080
It's about whether it can be
done with those new members.

221
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:23,520
It's a prayer for a key event, the
peace conference with the highlands.

222
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,350
We cannot risk failure of any kind.

223
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:31,320
All I'm asking for is a Ri Majon
performed by Chor Tempest.

224
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:34,230
If you cannot comply
with my request...

225
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,200
What will you do?

226
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:41,900
I don't want my daughter
to suffer any more humiliation.

227
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:44,380
I don't want her to get hurt.

228
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:05,590
Mamina! You want to challenge
me in the maju pool too?

229
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,500
Challenge you?

230
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:10,530
To decide who'll pair up with Neviril.

231
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,500
It's not a matter of challenging you.

232
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,010
What are you doing?

233
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,950
As long as we have these outfits on...

234
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:27,510
...the helical motors activate, allowing
us to float! But if it's removed...

235
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,710
You crazy?

236
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:30,520
Say you'll give up on her!

237
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:32,180
Cut it out!

238
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:34,260
I'm going to pair with her!

239
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,990
Same for me! But that's up to her!

240
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,630
You're of low birth and only made it
here because you can fly a Simoun!

241
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,230
One such as you is unworthy of her!

242
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,500
The same goes for you too!

243
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,510
Let go of me!

244
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,510
Aer!

245
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:06,550
As long as such breaches
of conduct continue...

246
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:10,260
...we can only conclude
Chor Tempest no longer functions.

247
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,860
By that, do you mean...

248
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:18,170
Once the peace conference
is over, I want Chor Tempest...

249
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:21,240
...to disband.

250
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,570
Please wait, Vice Chancellor!

251
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,980
Then what of your daughter?

252
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,550
That's the point.

253
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:33,450
I can't leave her in this chor. She'll go
to the Spring before she's hurt further.

254
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:36,580
U-Um, then what about me?

255
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,660
You've disappointed me.

256
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:47,850
It is played by my wounds...
the song of prayer.

257
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:52,090
Let it ring out over
the grieving universe.

258
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:59,130
Can we change tomorrow?
Don't be afraid.

259
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:06,770
I want to let you know
how my heart's overflowing.

260
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:19,650
"I want to get closer to you."
"I want to feel your pulse."

261
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,820
I was too defiant,
and I took the long way around.

262
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:28,830
The blue moon is swaying silently.

263
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:32,840
My true heart's desire is you.

264
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:38,240
I can't reach you.
My tears of pain trickle down.

265
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:44,240
Soar away into the sky, song of prayer.

266
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:47,680
Carrying my love that came too late.

267
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:53,350
What can I do to change tomorrow?

268
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:59,800
Just hold on to "now" the way it is...

269
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:05,810
To Be Continued

270
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:06,640
To Be Continued
The highland priestess named Anglas...

271
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,230
The highland priestess named Anglas...

272
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:12,400
...will be staying with
Chor Tempest for the time being.

273
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,050
Prayer
Next time on Simoun...

274
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:18,420
Prayer
Prayer.

275
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,580
Prayer
