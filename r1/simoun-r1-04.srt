1
00:00:00,524 --> 00:00:09,454
The countless flowers,
enveloped in light...

2
00:00:09,564 --> 00:00:19,734
...gaze at tomorrow
with unwavering eyes.

3
00:00:32,154 --> 00:00:39,064
Everyone wishes for me to be pure...

4
00:00:39,364 --> 00:00:46,464
...but what can I bring
with me to the frayed skies?

5
00:00:46,574 --> 00:00:53,634
What I've made my own
by breaking off flowers in bloom...

6
00:00:53,914 --> 00:00:59,214
All such sinful things...

7
00:00:59,314 --> 00:01:06,684
Why did I stop making
promises with the future?

8
00:01:06,794 --> 00:01:13,954
Because even if I try
to run far from all the pain...

9
00:01:14,064 --> 00:01:20,734
...a cold wind rustles
my hair... Don't you see?

10
00:01:20,834 --> 00:01:28,174
Where can I ever find the answer?

11
00:01:59,274 --> 00:02:05,234
The Nearby War

12
00:02:18,064 --> 00:02:21,394
That wraps up
the patrol flight schedule.

13
00:02:24,664 --> 00:02:28,664
Have you authorized
mobilization of Chor Tempest?

14
00:02:32,374 --> 00:02:33,864
We're still flying?

15
00:02:33,974 --> 00:02:38,414
You said we couldn't gauge
Simoun chemistry otherwise, Morinas.

16
00:02:38,514 --> 00:02:42,784
I've had enough!
You're amazing, Aer.

17
00:02:42,884 --> 00:02:44,284
So can we...

18
00:02:44,384 --> 00:02:48,914
We haven't done a Ri Majon yet.
Let's try the Ray Ri Majon.

19
00:02:57,064 --> 00:02:59,034
Look at Aer go!

20
00:03:05,674 --> 00:03:06,734
Morinas.

21
00:03:06,844 --> 00:03:09,814
It's too complicated! I'm confused!

22
00:03:15,884 --> 00:03:18,354
Morinas, focus.

23
00:03:18,454 --> 00:03:19,654
All right.

24
00:03:19,754 --> 00:03:21,984
Just wait... Wait.

25
00:04:07,204 --> 00:04:12,074
Chor Tempest is currently grounded
until its newest members arrive...

26
00:04:12,444 --> 00:04:14,744
...Sibylla Aer.

27
00:04:14,844 --> 00:04:18,304
If we don't practice,
it'll be tough when trouble comes.

28
00:04:18,684 --> 00:04:22,914
Then use Similes.
After you've received permission.

29
00:04:24,984 --> 00:04:27,114
Aer! Morinas!

30
00:04:33,594 --> 00:04:35,434
Why'd you pray without permission?

31
00:04:35,434 --> 00:04:38,404
Why'd you pray without permission?
It was a battle drill, not a prayer.

32
00:04:41,474 --> 00:04:43,734
Why are you scolding us?

33
00:04:43,844 --> 00:04:47,034
You're not even
the regina of Chor Tempest.

34
00:04:47,714 --> 00:04:52,344
The regina of our chor,
Neviril, is indisposed.

35
00:04:52,454 --> 00:04:54,684
In the meantime, I'm stepping in.

36
00:04:54,784 --> 00:04:59,684
Oh? Don't tell me
that you and Sibylla Aurea...

37
00:04:59,794 --> 00:05:02,654
...have that kind of special relationship.

38
00:05:20,274 --> 00:05:22,374
Aer! You forgot something!

39
00:05:26,254 --> 00:05:30,744
The kiss of gratitude. After exiting
the Simoun, Tempus Spatium...

40
00:05:30,854 --> 00:05:33,284
I couldn't care less about that.

41
00:05:33,394 --> 00:05:36,184
Do you hate doing it with me?

42
00:05:41,434 --> 00:05:45,764
Waporif, I'm sorry. We might've
gotten you in trouble too.

43
00:05:46,034 --> 00:05:50,374
It's our job to launch
Simouns when sibyllae request it.

44
00:05:55,544 --> 00:05:57,204
How cold.

45
00:05:57,314 --> 00:05:59,844
She's a child. You needn't tease her.

46
00:05:59,954 --> 00:06:02,114
Tease? Why would I?

47
00:06:04,084 --> 00:06:09,024
But you know what? Flying with
that girl was simply wonderful.

48
00:06:17,304 --> 00:06:18,594
Aer.

49
00:06:20,204 --> 00:06:22,504
That was amazing, Aer.

50
00:06:22,604 --> 00:06:25,734
Which Ri Majon
were you trying before?

51
00:06:26,374 --> 00:06:29,504
Aer, don't do anything like that again.

52
00:06:30,314 --> 00:06:34,114
Why not? Are you all okay
with the way things are?

53
00:06:34,214 --> 00:06:39,014
When will they put Chor Tempest
on duty to relieve the other chors?

54
00:06:40,124 --> 00:06:41,754
At this rate...

55
00:06:42,094 --> 00:06:46,684
If that happens, we can go back
to being normal Simoun sibyllae.

56
00:06:46,794 --> 00:06:50,694
Offering prayers and waiting
for our time to go to the Spring.

57
00:06:50,804 --> 00:06:53,234
The day I choose to become male.

58
00:06:53,334 --> 00:06:55,934
I can hardly wait, Big Sister.

59
00:06:57,044 --> 00:07:01,234
I'm planning to choose
the male gender myself, Alty.

60
00:07:02,344 --> 00:07:04,104
You all think so?

61
00:07:04,214 --> 00:07:07,744
That it's fine to not
go into battle anymore?

62
00:07:12,194 --> 00:07:13,654
It's Chor Rubor.

63
00:07:14,224 --> 00:07:17,684
Making a safe return
again today, I hope.

64
00:07:26,634 --> 00:07:29,574
You tried to do
the Ray Ri Majon, right?

65
00:07:29,674 --> 00:07:31,434
You are a genius after all.

66
00:07:32,574 --> 00:07:36,034
You can't even do
a simple thing like that...

67
00:07:36,144 --> 00:07:39,484
I wonder if this really
is Chor Tempest?

68
00:07:43,584 --> 00:07:46,184
Is that how you feel too, Neviril?

69
00:07:46,294 --> 00:07:50,884
That it doesn't matter as long
as you don't go into battle anymore?

70
00:07:50,994 --> 00:07:53,894
How could anyone want to go to war?

71
00:07:53,994 --> 00:07:57,024
Aer, we are merely...

72
00:07:57,134 --> 00:08:01,864
...fulfilling our duties as priestesses
protecting Tempus Spatium.

73
00:08:01,974 --> 00:08:04,874
Then you fulfill that duty too!

74
00:08:05,574 --> 00:08:10,874
Let me make myself clear.
Aer, you and I will never be a pair.

75
00:08:25,064 --> 00:08:27,294
I'm Vura of Chor Rubor.

76
00:08:27,394 --> 00:08:29,594
We'll be roommates starting today.

77
00:08:29,704 --> 00:08:33,764
Is that right? I'm Aer of Chor Tempest.

78
00:08:34,334 --> 00:08:36,674
You're an auriga, right?

79
00:08:36,774 --> 00:08:40,364
I am too.
Say, has that Neviril always been...

80
00:08:40,474 --> 00:08:46,004
Since Chor Tempest is off active duty,
my chor's been split into two units...

81
00:08:46,114 --> 00:08:48,584
...doing patrol flights night and day.

82
00:08:48,684 --> 00:08:52,144
We don't have the luxury
of lazing around like you people.

83
00:08:52,254 --> 00:08:54,154
Let me sleep.

84
00:09:05,034 --> 00:09:09,404
I bet I can fly in a way
that would satisfy even you.

85
00:09:09,504 --> 00:09:10,704
Perhaps.

86
00:09:10,804 --> 00:09:12,774
Then come with me.

87
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:29,784
Everyone's in
the cafeteria at this hour.

88
00:09:29,864 --> 00:09:31,194
But...

89
00:09:31,294 --> 00:09:34,424
It's all right. I grabbed dinner for us.

90
00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:36,424
That's not it...

91
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:39,434
What a pain in the butt...

92
00:09:41,574 --> 00:09:42,534
Um...

93
00:09:42,644 --> 00:09:44,664
Here, your half.

94
00:09:44,774 --> 00:09:46,074
Also...

95
00:09:48,844 --> 00:09:49,974
Let's go.

96
00:10:00,124 --> 00:10:02,454
Which Ri Majon first?

97
00:10:02,564 --> 00:10:04,184
Which do you like?

98
00:10:04,294 --> 00:10:06,124
I don't know...

99
00:10:06,234 --> 00:10:08,284
You must like one.

100
00:10:08,394 --> 00:10:11,454
The Silver Ri Majon... I guess.

101
00:10:11,934 --> 00:10:15,204
Yeah? That's a good one.

102
00:10:15,804 --> 00:10:19,974
But if we're going to,
let's do it when we find the enemy.

103
00:10:20,074 --> 00:10:21,804
You're going into battle?

104
00:10:22,144 --> 00:10:27,104
If we do, they won't be able
to ground our chor anymore.

105
00:10:28,214 --> 00:10:29,814
Isn't that right?

106
00:10:29,924 --> 00:10:31,544
You think so?

107
00:10:33,094 --> 00:10:34,284
Aer...

108
00:10:46,334 --> 00:10:47,804
Is that...

109
00:10:53,644 --> 00:10:55,164
It's a Simoun.

110
00:10:55,274 --> 00:11:00,274
The new recruits in Chor Caput
are out on patrol tonight, right?

111
00:11:01,084 --> 00:11:02,574
Why's it there?

112
00:11:02,684 --> 00:11:05,084
Maybe they were attacked.

113
00:11:05,184 --> 00:11:09,884
Then they've got info on the enemy.
Let's make sure the area's secure first.

114
00:11:13,894 --> 00:11:15,264
Just one unit.

115
00:11:15,364 --> 00:11:18,594
I'm in luck. This will be my last...

116
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:44,264
It has to be Aer!
And with Rimone this time!

117
00:11:44,364 --> 00:11:47,454
Rimone? But that's my pair...

118
00:11:47,734 --> 00:11:49,854
She rejected me too.

119
00:11:50,764 --> 00:11:53,964
It's not really
a matter of being rejected...

120
00:11:54,074 --> 00:11:58,304
Another unauthorized flight?
I wish my chor had free time.

121
00:11:58,404 --> 00:12:02,474
This means the end of
Chor Tempest. We're going to be busy.

122
00:12:02,584 --> 00:12:04,674
Should we notify the dux?

123
00:12:04,784 --> 00:12:07,804
If we don't get them,
we're all accountable.

124
00:12:08,154 --> 00:12:10,914
Why don't we leave them alone?

125
00:12:12,254 --> 00:12:15,154
If they want to fly,
we should let them fly.

126
00:12:16,064 --> 00:12:18,324
They'll be back by morning.

127
00:12:18,424 --> 00:12:21,154
We can't move
the Arcus Prima right now.

128
00:12:22,364 --> 00:12:25,894
Just what kind of
priestess is this Aer girl?

129
00:12:28,804 --> 00:12:30,504
All that is certain...

130
00:12:30,944 --> 00:12:33,674
...is that she has a reason.

131
00:12:34,074 --> 00:12:36,344
A reason for being here.

132
00:12:55,434 --> 00:12:57,224
It's a fake...

133
00:13:00,934 --> 00:13:02,064
Rimone!

134
00:13:02,704 --> 00:13:04,004
Aer!

135
00:13:04,204 --> 00:13:05,834
Damn you...

136
00:13:13,054 --> 00:13:15,914
That's right.
We're both Simoun sibyllae.

137
00:13:16,284 --> 00:13:20,914
So it's true when they say that young
girls fly the Simouns in Kyuukoku.

138
00:13:26,734 --> 00:13:30,794
The disease is eating
away at our bodies.

139
00:13:32,204 --> 00:13:34,724
We are in need of new technology.

140
00:13:34,834 --> 00:13:37,894
The secret of Simouns,
hidden by Kyuukoku.

141
00:13:38,004 --> 00:13:39,944
If we can acquire that...

142
00:13:40,044 --> 00:13:44,344
...we can bid farewell to
technology that pollutes the skies.

143
00:14:01,464 --> 00:14:04,994
I did it... I've taken a Simoun...

144
00:14:05,364 --> 00:14:08,494
I'm not going to retire from the military!

145
00:14:09,374 --> 00:14:12,004
Glory to Shoukoku!

146
00:14:19,754 --> 00:14:21,114
It's useless!

147
00:14:21,214 --> 00:14:25,954
You soldiers from Shoukoku aren't
protected by Tempus Spatium!

148
00:14:26,154 --> 00:14:30,454
Only priestesses who haven't gone
to the Spring can operate Simouns!

149
00:14:30,564 --> 00:14:34,724
Only us, people who haven't
decided on a gender yet!

150
00:14:37,034 --> 00:14:39,464
Tell me how to fly it!

151
00:14:41,734 --> 00:14:43,174
Tell me!

152
00:15:21,974 --> 00:15:24,474
Aer, what do we do?

153
00:15:25,384 --> 00:15:27,404
We retake the Simoun.

154
00:15:27,514 --> 00:15:29,454
Don't talk so loud!

155
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:34,014
He can't understand our words anyway.
Shoukoku wants the Simouns.

156
00:15:34,124 --> 00:15:39,754
Since only Simouns fly freely through
the skies. But we can't hand it over.

157
00:15:39,864 --> 00:15:40,984
Aer...

158
00:15:43,134 --> 00:15:47,124
All of my friends
have gone to the Spring.

159
00:15:47,234 --> 00:15:50,404
I'm the only one
in my village who hasn't.

160
00:15:50,504 --> 00:15:53,494
Why don't you want to go, Aer?

161
00:15:53,614 --> 00:15:59,414
Because I'm not sure. Whether I want
to become a man or stay a woman.

162
00:15:59,514 --> 00:16:03,174
If you go, they say Onasia
chooses if you haven't decided.

163
00:16:03,284 --> 00:16:06,984
Having someone else choose
is worse! No, I don't want that!

164
00:16:07,094 --> 00:16:10,454
I can't afford to make
mistakes in a place like this.

165
00:16:10,564 --> 00:16:13,964
I'll become the best
Simoun sibylla of all.

166
00:16:14,064 --> 00:16:18,934
After all, as long as I fly a Simoun,
I won't have to go to the Spring.

167
00:16:22,874 --> 00:16:25,344
Tell me, young ladies...

168
00:16:26,044 --> 00:16:29,704
How does it feel?
Not to be a man or woman?

169
00:16:31,044 --> 00:16:33,074
You don't understand, do you?

170
00:16:35,484 --> 00:16:39,824
I was turned male via medicine
and surgery right when I was born.

171
00:16:39,924 --> 00:16:43,224
That's the way things
are done in Shoukoku.

172
00:16:43,324 --> 00:16:46,454
That's why I have no idea.

173
00:16:46,564 --> 00:16:48,794
Being born in a female body...

174
00:16:48,894 --> 00:16:54,134
...and then being able to choose
whether to become a man or woman.

175
00:16:54,234 --> 00:16:56,334
How does that feel?

176
00:17:03,284 --> 00:17:06,114
Do you think that man is ill?

177
00:17:56,564 --> 00:17:57,654
Go! Fly!

178
00:17:57,764 --> 00:18:00,294
Come on, fly! What's wrong, demon?

179
00:18:00,404 --> 00:18:02,374
Why won't you fly?

180
00:18:08,144 --> 00:18:10,874
Sorry, young ladies.

181
00:18:11,284 --> 00:18:14,644
I can't hand this over
to you. It's mine now.

182
00:18:14,754 --> 00:18:20,014
If I can just take this back,
my country will usher in a new era.

183
00:18:20,124 --> 00:18:22,684
The skies will clear...

184
00:18:24,524 --> 00:18:27,464
No matter what, I'm going to...

185
00:18:36,174 --> 00:18:39,334
Like I said, you can't fly a Simoun.

186
00:18:39,444 --> 00:18:43,844
His comrades might come for him.
In Shoukoku aircraft...

187
00:18:46,484 --> 00:18:50,684
I won't let him have it.
He'll never take the Simoun.

188
00:19:23,484 --> 00:19:25,354
Help me get him down.

189
00:19:25,454 --> 00:19:27,924
We need to get back right away.

190
00:19:34,164 --> 00:19:35,854
He's all stiff.

191
00:19:36,064 --> 00:19:39,334
Let go! Let go! Let go, will you?

192
00:19:39,974 --> 00:19:41,834
Don't. It'll break.

193
00:19:46,514 --> 00:19:49,964
I'm sure someone
will come looking for us...

194
00:19:50,084 --> 00:19:51,574
Then we can...

195
00:19:51,684 --> 00:19:53,014
No.

196
00:19:53,114 --> 00:19:57,574
We don't know when the enemy will
come. We have to take off right away.

197
00:19:57,684 --> 00:20:02,814
And we can't ever report that we
nearly got captured by the enemy.

198
00:20:04,624 --> 00:20:08,254
If only these hands on
the flight stick could be removed...

199
00:20:09,864 --> 00:20:11,834
It can't be helped...

200
00:20:13,204 --> 00:20:15,224
It can't be helped.

201
00:20:16,234 --> 00:20:19,334
Rimone, you can
go over there till I'm done.

202
00:20:19,444 --> 00:20:21,744
Hurry! Go over there!

203
00:20:54,414 --> 00:20:55,814
Ow...

204
00:21:03,224 --> 00:21:04,514
Rimone!

205
00:21:04,624 --> 00:21:07,684
Rimone! Help me carry him, Rimone!

206
00:21:08,424 --> 00:21:10,514
Are you awake, Rimone?

207
00:21:11,064 --> 00:21:12,254
Rimone!

208
00:21:49,964 --> 00:21:53,234
I guess I made trouble for you again.

209
00:21:53,334 --> 00:21:55,734
As an apology,
we'll clean it ourselves.

210
00:21:56,104 --> 00:21:59,004
You don't have to do that, Sibylla Aer.

211
00:21:59,104 --> 00:22:00,974
It's fine. We want to.

212
00:22:01,074 --> 00:22:03,204
Rimone, if you please.

213
00:22:11,384 --> 00:22:15,754
Taking on the task of
cleaning the Simoun themselves?

214
00:22:15,854 --> 00:22:18,584
They're starting to recognize
that they're priestesses.

215
00:22:19,194 --> 00:22:20,824
You think so?

216
00:22:25,764 --> 00:22:26,894
I'm sorry.

217
00:22:27,604 --> 00:22:29,694
For getting you so dirty.

218
00:22:40,954 --> 00:22:47,584
It is played by my wounds...
the song of prayer.

219
00:22:47,694 --> 00:22:51,824
Let it ring out over
the grieving universe.

220
00:22:51,924 --> 00:22:58,894
Can we change tomorrow?
Don't be afraid.

221
00:22:59,004 --> 00:23:06,774
I want to let you know
how my heart's overflowing.

222
00:23:15,384 --> 00:23:19,374
"I want to get closer to you."
"I want to feel your pulse."

223
00:23:19,484 --> 00:23:24,554
I was too defiant,
and I took the long way around.

224
00:23:24,664 --> 00:23:28,564
The blue moon is swaying silently.

225
00:23:28,664 --> 00:23:32,534
My true heart's desire is you.

226
00:23:32,634 --> 00:23:37,904
I can't reach you.
My tears of pain trickle down.

227
00:23:38,544 --> 00:23:43,984
Soar away into the sky, song of prayer.

228
00:23:44,084 --> 00:23:47,444
Carrying my love that came too late.

229
00:23:47,554 --> 00:23:53,084
What can I do to change tomorrow?

230
00:23:53,194 --> 00:23:59,324
Just hold on to "now" the way it is...

231
00:24:04,764 --> 00:24:06,394
To Be Continued

232
00:24:07,234 --> 00:24:12,234
Will Dominüra be up
to the task of guiding Rimone?

233
00:24:14,514 --> 00:24:15,274
Next time on Simoun...

234
00:24:15,274 --> 00:24:16,274
White Loneliness
Next time on Simoun...

235
00:24:16,274 --> 00:24:19,734
White Loneliness
White Loneliness.
