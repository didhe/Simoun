1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:09,760
The countless flowers,
enveloped in light...

2
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:20,370
...gaze at tomorrow
with unwavering eyes.

3
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:39,030
Everyone wishes for me to be pure...

4
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:46,730
...but what can I bring
with me to the frayed skies?

5
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:53,910
What I've made my own
by breaking off flowers in bloom...

6
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:59,480
All such sinful things...

7
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:06,960
Why did I stop making
promises with the future?

8
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:14,230
Because even if I try
to run far from all the pain...

9
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,970
...a cold wind rustles
my hair... Don't you see?

10
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:28,480
Where can I ever find the answer?

11
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:32,180
Dominüra?

12
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,320
You said you'd
do it for me, right?

13
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:39,720
The Emerald Ri Majon.

14
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,660
The Simouns are the
vehicles of the gods.

15
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:47,960
They can't fall.

16
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:51,200
But that's...

17
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,930
...the Emerald Ri Majon!

18
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:05,940
The Ruins

19
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,580
Hey, check that out
for me, will you?

20
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,320
Adjust the oil pressure for
the communication-wire ejectors!

21
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,260
I need somebody to
pull on this for me!

22
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,560
So we're going to be
working here again.

23
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,600
Yes.

24
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,470
First off, I want you all
to thoroughly pinpoint...

25
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,340
...the areas that sustained damage.

26
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,970
Right! We're already on it!

27
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:05,910
How is the old place?

28
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:10,980
Sibylla...

29
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,220
You look well. Glad to see it.

30
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:16,820
Yes.

31
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:17,920
Likewise.

32
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,890
We just got back, and things
are already hectic, I see.

33
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,090
Yes, we were told to put a
rush on the Simoun repairs.

34
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,230
Hmm.

35
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,270
Um.

36
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,240
Huh?

37
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,400
Excuse me.

38
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,100
I need you to take
a look at the lift.

39
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,240
Fine.

40
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,180
Sibylla.

41
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,240
Please excuse me.

42
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:42,620
All right.

43
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:55,560
Now that Shoukoku and the
highlands have formed an alliance...

44
00:03:55,630 --> 00:04:00,160
...it's only a matter of
time before they attack.

45
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:06,430
Meaning we'll have to ask the sibyllae
again to carry out such a cruel task.

46
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:07,940
It's not a request.

47
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,340
It's an order, Guragief.

48
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,950
All of this happened
because of me.

49
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,990
All because of
my own selfishness!

50
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,530
To think that I could ever forget
Amuria and the Emerald Ri Majon...

51
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:31,530
How could you have
been so naïve, Neviril?

52
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:54,850
There are so many things that
must never be forgotten, Neviril!

53
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,880
Dominüra and Rimone...

54
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,750
They vanished, didn't they?

55
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,250
The Emerald Ri Majon...

56
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,250
...failed, I suppose.

57
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,530
Or maybe what really happened
was that they copped out!

58
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:42,730
If that were true, it would at
least offer some consolation.

59
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,640
No. What matters is not
the cause but the result.

60
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:51,750
For once again, we have lost
precious comrades of ours.

61
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,250
We've come home to the
Arcus Prima, haven't we?

62
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,890
How can you be so
cavalier about this, Floe?

63
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:11,730
Then are you saying that you're
not glad to be back, Alty?

64
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,930
Of course I'm glad!

65
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,770
Sure I'm glad, but still...

66
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,800
Come on, we're going to
be roommates, you know.

67
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,210
Let's try to get along.

68
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:24,340
I guess you're right.

69
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,830
Welcome back, everyone...

70
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,200
...to the Arcus Prima!

71
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:53,200
I know that you have all gone through
many changes during this time...

72
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:54,110
...and we are most...

73
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,210
...and we are most...
The center was destroyed in the attack.

74
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:56,840
The center was destroyed in the attack.

75
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:01,140
As for the 12 Simouns belonging
to Chor Rubor and Chor Caput...

76
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,580
...we had no choice but to abandon
any hopes of restoring them.

77
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:04,680
At this time...

78
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,240
...the only chor remaining
on the Arcus Prima...

79
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:10,050
...is your own, Chor Tempest.

80
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,920
High Priestess.

81
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,560
What has become of the members
of Chor Rubor and Chor Caput?

82
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:17,690
Nearly all of the sibyllae
have gone to the Spring.

83
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,670
You mean you gave them the axe.

84
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,660
Watch your mouth, Aer!

85
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,670
Come on, you know it's true!

86
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,330
If there are no Simouns
to fly, they don't need us.

87
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:27,400
Silence!

88
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:38,080
Now then, there's somebody here
who would like to meet with you all.

89
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,960
Father!

90
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,670
Welcome home, Neviril.

91
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,300
I have returned, Father.

92
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:06,010
That goes for all of you
Chor Tempest sibyllae.

93
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,070
We are happy that you
made it back safely.

94
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,980
Father.

95
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:12,250
Oh, that's right.

96
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:13,680
Yes, I know.

97
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:18,550
Sibylla Rimone and Sibylla
Dominüra are no longer with us.

98
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,080
That's right.

99
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,820
We are now headed toward the Ruins.

100
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:26,330
The Ruins?

101
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:28,100
Why the Ruins?

102
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:30,030
We all know it's
no simple matter to...

103
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,230
You are correct, Sibylla Yun.

104
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:37,640
The Ruins happen to be the holiest
place in all of Simulacrum Kyuukoku.

105
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,940
Not to mention a forbidden area.

106
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:42,010
However, it is imperative that...

107
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:48,040
...we reach the Ruins before the
forces of Shoukoku and the highlands.

108
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,050
By any chance...

109
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:02,370
Yes, what is your
question, Sibylla Floe?

110
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,130
By any chance, are you forcing us?

111
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,810
The only ones in all of
Simulacrum Kyuukoku...

112
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,850
...who have the ability
to execute this strategy...

113
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,180
This is not a request.

114
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:20,780
You are all expected to participate
in this battle without exception.

115
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:25,880
I guess this means we don't have the
right to go to the Spring anymore.

116
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,290
Yes.

117
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,550
Most likely...

118
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:33,030
...we have nowhere to escape to.

119
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,460
The only thing we
can do is move on.

120
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:34,090
I never thought I'd get the opportunity
to speak with you like this again.

121
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:35,320
No.

122
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,250
Neviril is no longer
the daughter I knew...

123
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:40,700
...who would do anything I'd ask of her.

124
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:45,070
And so there is nothing
more I can do for you.

125
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:50,210
Oh, no. I am grateful that you took
me under your wing, Vice Chancellor.

126
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:53,110
What?

127
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,310
No...

128
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,140
It's just that you seem
to be a changed person.

129
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,350
Yes.

130
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,370
We owe you our lives.

131
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:30,510
If it hadn't been for the Arcus Prima,
the Messis would have surely fallen.

132
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,320
You have done well.

133
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,980
Thank goodness we were in time.

134
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:35,560
But still, Captain...

135
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,520
Yes?

136
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:42,730
You entrusted me with 12 sibyllae,
and I failed to return them all to you.

137
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,020
Please forgive me.

138
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,630
Captain Wauf.

139
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:46,490
Yes?

140
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:49,130
A detailed report can wait.

141
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,500
In your opinion...

142
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:54,640
...are Sibylla Dominüra
and Sibylla Rimone...

143
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,770
I believe that they are both alive.

144
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:01,710
Then what exactly happened to them?

145
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:04,340
That I don't know. However...

146
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:09,350
Perhaps we will find the answer
to that question at the Ruins.

147
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:33,280
Neviril!

148
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:34,470
Aer, quickly!

149
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:35,980
Right!

150
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:42,560
Neviril.

151
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:43,320
What is it?

152
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:43,660
What is it?
Oh... nothing.

153
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,620
Oh... nothing.

154
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,330
Para-sama! Hurry!

155
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,810
I know this is hardest on you.

156
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:18,890
No.

157
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:22,460
I'm not the one who
has to suffer the most.

158
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:02,830
Look.

159
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,910
As planned...

160
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,710
...with communication cables
intact, Chor Tempest...

161
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,750
...will descend as low as possible...

162
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:21,380
...and protect the Ruins from attack
by the Shoukoku-highland forces.

163
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,850
So these are the Ruins.

164
00:14:58,490 --> 00:14:59,460
Yes.

165
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,350
This is my first time here as well.

166
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,860
This is Tempus Spatium's holy land.

167
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:07,600
I don't think the enemy
is here yet, do you?

168
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,330
Don't let your guard down!

169
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,300
Oh, don't be so bossy!

170
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,340
Two o'clock!

171
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:13,170
What?

172
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,240
What's that?

173
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,340
Could those be Simouns?

174
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:30,420
But I've never seen
anything like them before!

175
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:31,360
Nor have I!

176
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,320
What should we do, Para-sama?

177
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,960
Para-sama!

178
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:37,830
Go after them!

179
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,560
Yes!

180
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,230
We'll take the one on the left!

181
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:44,600
Leave it to me!

182
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,370
Are they planning to attack?

183
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:07,620
The Shark Ri Majon?

184
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,860
No way!

185
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,230
The enemy?

186
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,960
Hurry, go after them, Para-sama!
We can't let them get away!

187
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,100
Who are they? Who's
operating those Simouns?

188
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:23,840
Who's flying those Simouns
to pray to the skies?

189
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:25,910
You're right.

190
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,570
How can they
possibly fly like that?

191
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,390
Enemies... Is that the enemy?

192
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,690
I won't let them get away!

193
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,560
They're firing at us!

194
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:41,960
I'm not afraid!

195
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:47,690
B-But, how could those
Simouns be enemies of ours?

196
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,540
Let's worry about that later, Floe!

197
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,540
Aer?

198
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,740
Aer, what do you
think you're doing?

199
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:58,940
Hurry!

200
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,440
Aer!

201
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,050
Leave the pursuit to the others.
Let's see what's inside those Ruins.

202
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,090
What?

203
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,590
What on earth are
you talking about?

204
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,590
My music box...

205
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,180
...it's playing now.

206
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:15,960
It's closed, but
it's still playing!

207
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:17,830
What?

208
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,090
They managed to get away.

209
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:50,800
What should we do now, Para-sama?

210
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,290
Head back to the Ruins.

211
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,100
Hey, it stopped.

212
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,900
Come on, let's go, Aer.

213
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,070
H-Hey...

214
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,570
Hold on a minute!

215
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:08,410
How come you're acting
like this all of a sudden?

216
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,410
But this is...

217
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:18,820
What's the matter, Neviril?

218
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:25,560
They think they're gonna get away!

219
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:26,700
Not if I have my way!

220
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,070
Huh? What the...

221
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:36,700
The Spring.

222
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:01,930
I hit it.

223
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,600
Just one down after all that?

224
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,680
Onasia!

225
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:20,450
Onasia...

226
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,980
I am glad that you're here...

227
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:25,990
...Sibylla Neviril...

228
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,120
...Sibylla Aer...

229
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:29,800
But why...

230
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,390
...why are you here, Onasia?

231
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:34,670
Sibylla Neviril...

232
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,630
...I happen to be everywhere.

233
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,630
And yet nowhere.

234
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,470
Can't catch up...

235
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,370
Who in the world
is flying that thing?

236
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:49,880
Good question.

237
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:53,040
And besides, there's something
not right about this place.

238
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:53,920
Let's go back!

239
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:54,920
Yes!

240
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:12,770
Onasia, how can...

241
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,100
...this place be exactly
the same as the Spring?

242
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,910
Tempus watches over
the flow of time.

243
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,640
While Spatium shows us
mankind's rightful place.

244
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,250
And when these two become a pair...

245
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:29,650
...they bestow boundless
blessings and fear to the people.

246
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:38,260
Yun?

247
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:43,800
Huh?

248
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:44,900
A Simoun?

249
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:58,920
Yun!

250
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,380
Yun, what's wrong?

251
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,890
This place... What exactly
is going on in this place?

252
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:12,460
Yun!

253
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:13,420
Yun!

254
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:15,490
Here in the Ruins...

255
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:18,600
...time and space...

256
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:24,100
...are released from all curses.

257
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,620
Hold on a second, Yun.

258
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:41,660
Just what was going on back there?

259
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:42,900
They're all...

260
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,200
...waiting for me.

261
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,790
Neviril.

262
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,630
I know what's going on.

263
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,830
This isn't just some place
that looks like the Spring.

264
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,210
What?

265
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,870
What do you mean, Aer?

266
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,870
This place is...

267
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:00,210
...the Spring itself.

268
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:02,620
It's just like Grandpa said!

269
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,230
Anglas!

270
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:30,110
Aer!

271
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:47,820
It is played by my wounds...
the song of prayer.

272
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:52,060
Let it ring out over
the grieving universe.

273
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:59,130
Can we change tomorrow?
Don't be afraid.

274
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:06,810
I want to let you know
how my heart's overflowing.

275
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:19,620
I want to get closer to you.
I want to feel your pulse.

276
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:24,790
I was too defiant,
and I took the long way around.

277
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,770
The blue moon is swaying silently.

278
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:32,810
My true heart's desire is you.

279
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:38,670
I can't reach you.
My tears of pain trickle down.

280
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:44,220
Soar away into the
sky, song of prayer.

281
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,650
Carrying my love that came too late.

282
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:53,320
What can I do to change tomorrow?

283
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:59,630
Just hold on to "now" the way it is...

284
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,660
To Be Continued

285
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:12,670
Aer and Mamina have been barred
from attending Anglas's funeral.

286
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,510
Next time on Simoun...

287
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,050
The Funeral

288
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:18,320
The Funeral
The Funeral.

289
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,010
The Funeral
