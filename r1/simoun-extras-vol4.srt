00:00:06,306 --> 00:00:11,266
<i>Junji and Asako's</i>
<i>Know-Your-Simoun Lecture</i>

2
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:17,407
So anyway,
I'm Junji Nishimura. Nice to meet you.

3
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:21,009
I'm the character designer,
animation supervisor...

4
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:23,988
...and light comic
relief director, Asako Nishida.

5
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:26,617
Um, and I'm the director.

6
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:30,021
Let's see, episode one...

7
00:00:30,663 --> 00:00:38,035
Well, I have to say that
episode one was all about quantity...

8
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:42,232
So that's what we
focused on... Sheer quantity.

9
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:44,173
Of enemies?

10
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:47,974
So what did you think
of the amount? Excessive?

11
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:49,878
I don't think so.

12
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:57,048
But you know how this scene
comes up in that clogged airspace?

13
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:59,887
Did you start this project
to shoot this scene?

14
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:02,985
Yes, I suppose you could say that.

15
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:09,399
Many people pointed out this would
never happen at such a moment.

16
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:12,994
Comments like "I'm sure
they had better things to do."

17
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:15,666
But I still wanted to do it.

18
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:17,402
And your reasons?

19
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,171
Well, you see...

20
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:24,515
When we were discussing how
realistic the story should be...

21
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:30,453
...I said this was what I wanted in
episode one, what I wanted to show.

22
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:35,858
The bizarre worldview, realistic
but at the same time contrived...

23
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:39,420
I wanted to do everything
I could in episode one.

24
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:44,026
But as far as the plot line went...

25
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:48,870
...I didn't want it
to follow a dramatic formula.

26
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:53,105
I wanted an "audience vs. me" feeling
and to remain conscious of that.

27
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:56,341
That was my plan for episode one.

28
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:02,553
So it seems the story got even more
confusing since little was explained.

29
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:08,389
But I thought that should be an aspect
of the overall <i>Simoun</i> worldview.

30
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:12,227
That's what I set out to do.
And this is how it turned out.

31
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:15,267
And I ended up getting mixed reviews.

32
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:20,272
So what did you think of episode one?

33
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,068
Oh, well... Let's see...

34
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:30,275
A lot of kissing scenes in <i>Simoun</i>
take place midair during battles...

35
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:33,276
Is that your experience?

36
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:36,981
Have I ever kissed
someone during an attack?

37
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:41,754
Was your first kiss a traumatic
experience or something?

38
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:44,830
No, mine happened
under a pine tree...

39
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:47,229
Under a pine tree?

40
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,563
So it wasn't like the show.

41
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:54,038
Proper, on a beautiful
beach, and with a pine tree.

42
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,074
Underthat tree.

43
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,973
Can your wife hearthat?

44
00:02:58,077 --> 00:02:59,135
It'd be bad.

45
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:00,769
It'd be bad?

46
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:03,875
See this? This scene here?

47
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:10,212
This scene is what you'd call the
heart and essence of the entire series.

48
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:11,722
As a matter of fact.

49
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:18,093
Did you notice how forced it was
going to that overwhelming red sky?

50
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,165
Yes.

51
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:23,429
And when we were done
with this draft of episode one...

52
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:28,667
...we gave it to Katoh for processing,
and we'll talk about him later on...

53
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,804
...and he asked,
"Are you really okay with this?"

54
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:38,714
He spoke of how the worldview
was real yet dramatically contrived.

55
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:42,178
How should I put it?

56
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:46,281
A world depicted in images.
Battle scenes, for instance.

57
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:50,886
And a significant number of
them were depicted in that style.

58
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:56,492
Personally, I think it worked out when
I saw the episode one storyboards...

59
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:59,766
...and I neverthought I'd
see the use of "harmonies"...

60
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:03,103
We call the pastel
freeze-frame shots "harmonies."

61
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:06,372
I never thought
I'd see harmonies used.

62
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,639
Oh, really?

63
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,147
When I first watched the episode...

64
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:14,812
...my personal opinion was that
the harmonies didn't really fit in.

65
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:20,192
But I can see quite a lot of
motivation behind those shots...

66
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:23,888
In episode one, those harmonies
appeared at least twice.

67
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:24,759
Yes.

68
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:26,331
Why'd you do them?

69
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:31,267
It was an artistic decision...
that also got mixed reviews.

70
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:34,172
Why did you do
those mural paintings?

71
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,937
I was flooded with so
many comments about that.

72
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:42,140
But you see... I couldn't
advance the story without them.

73
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:47,311
There was no other way to link
the scenes. That's all I can say.

74
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:53,115
So it was a directorial decision?

75
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:55,660
I'd have to say yes.

76
00:04:55,762 --> 00:05:00,825
There were people who asked me
if I was an Osamu Dezaki disciple.

77
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:04,562
Sure, I respect him,
but I'm not a disciple.

78
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:11,543
Well, let me ask you this.
The art director is Kobayashi-san...

79
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:17,514
So I was wondering if he was the one
with a real affinity for harmonies.

80
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:22,281
Well, of course he would
never say he wanted to do them.

81
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:23,446
Right.

82
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:29,552
But if I want to do harmonies,
and he does the artwork...

83
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:33,894
...there's no way we'd end up
without harmonies, you see.

84
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,434
That was yourthought as director?

85
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:39,004
Because after all, he...

86
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:46,971
He's a purist who holds on to
the old-school way of doing artwork.

87
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:54,785
Today, there's so much you
can do with digital processing...

88
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:59,290
...but he's the type who does all
he can to work in the old style.

89
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:07,492
And anotherthing... Today, you
never see cel animation anymore...

90
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:10,592
...but he still has them somehow.

91
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,466
He does?

92
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:15,939
And he turns in cels that he's drawn.

93
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:17,110
You wouldn't believe it...

94
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,044
You wouldn't believe it...
Here we go.

95
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:20,737
She'll chop them off!

96
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:23,338
She'll create a huge scene.

97
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:30,348
We show the corpse in
a series of harmonies here too.

98
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:31,787
That's right.

99
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:39,860
You know, I really,
really love this scene.

100
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:45,963
Was that one
of your creative decisions?

101
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,802
To have her chop up the body?

102
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:52,935
No, actually... I didn't write this scene.

103
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:58,073
When the first script was turned in,
it was actually even more graphic.

104
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:01,778
Do you think it's
all right to describe it now?

105
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:03,515
Sure, why not.

106
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,056
Long story short...

107
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:10,186
...she chops off his fingers to remove
them from the steering wheel, right?

108
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:12,787
Either his fingers or his wrists.

109
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:16,596
But in the earlier version,
she actually mutilated...

110
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:19,967
Did she dismember his whole body?

111
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:25,601
That's right. She dismembers him
and disposes of him piece by piece.

112
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:28,407
The first draft was brutal.

113
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:32,006
And I wanted to keep that
quality as much as possible...

114
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:36,452
...but when I started considering
the <i>Simoun</i> worldview...

115
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:41,516
...I wasn't sure I could go that
far in terms of repulsive behavior.

116
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:45,256
It was really
a challenge in that respect.

117
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:52,435
But it was this scene that
made me see Aer as a young girl.

118
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,606
Oh, I see.

119
00:07:56,843 --> 00:08:02,645
I read in the DVD's liner notes that
most dismemberment homicides...

120
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:06,849
...are committed by females
to an overwhelming degree.

121
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:08,250
Is that so?

122
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:11,323
Because women aren't
strong enough to carry corpses.

123
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:13,551
So we were on point.

124
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:17,862
Uh, we were just
talking about corpses...

125
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:21,593
...and suddenly we're seeing
someone get their nails done.

126
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:29,573
This is another scene that
didn't follow the original script.

127
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:32,476
She wasn't doing her nails.

128
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:34,512
What was it then?

129
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:39,945
Well, it was much simpler.
She was pouring tea for her.

130
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:43,544
I think that was how the scene went.

131
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,559
Then the episode director said, "No...

132
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:50,719
...it won't work unless
there's some touching involved."

133
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:54,163
Oh, you mean
to transition to the next scene?

134
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:55,996
He set that up?

135
00:08:56,102 --> 00:09:00,562
Yes, he said that
to set up the next scene...

136
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:04,332
...we had to show
their hands touching.

137
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:10,639
But in that version of the script,
this scene... or was it the next?

138
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,810
When they're in
the maintenance hangar...

139
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:17,454
Going "pow-pow-pow-pow-pow!"

140
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:24,557
That scene originally happened
in one of the girls' rooms.

141
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:31,231
And then they fall on top of
one other, getting a little cozy...

142
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:34,101
That was supposed
to happen on a bed.

143
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:36,670
Originally.

144
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:39,944
Well, a bedroom
would've been fine too...

145
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:44,983
...but personally, I think it's more
appealing under that blue ceiling.

146
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,951
Oh? I'm very sorry about that.

147
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:49,385
Did you flinch?

148
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:51,479
Just a little, I think.

149
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,560
Really? Come on,
you've got to follow my lead.

150
00:09:55,061 --> 00:10:00,966
But anyway, this scene really fits in
with the <i>Simoun</i> worldview, right?

151
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:04,369
Yes. It's pretty symbolic, isn't it?

152
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:10,771
What happens next when Kaim...

153
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:17,348
Seeing whether Paraietta sees
Kaim or not was really interesting.

154
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:20,345
You mean Alty?

155
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,422
Oh, sorry. Not Kaim, I mean Alty.

156
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:28,558
At this point, Alty is watching
all this unfold behind the curtain...

157
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:31,027
Right, it's a given she's watching.

158
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:35,760
But how about the other way around?
Is that why Paraietta stopped?

159
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:43,501
Didn't you theorize she held back
since she saw Alty watching?

160
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:44,769
Theorize...

161
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:48,536
I think you're pretty much on the nose.

162
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,082
l-Is that your official approval?

163
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,888
This is just so
well made, this scene...

164
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:02,757
But yesterday, you said Paraietta's
feelings were the easiest to get.

165
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:05,660
It's easiest to get Paraietta's feelings.

166
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:11,300
So for our information, you can't resist
a girl with glasses hitting on you?

167
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:14,134
Why do you keep turning
it into a personal thing?

168
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:20,201
My goal is to expose the director's
personality through his show.

169
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:25,381
Well, uh... it doesn't have
to be a girl with glasses.

170
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:30,179
You're so generous.

171
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:34,752
I have very liberal standards
when it comes to that.

172
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,526
Paraietta's braless from this angle.

173
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:43,795
This is... Wow.

174
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,237
"Wow."

175
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:49,331
We had the character designs. You
decided she'd have this body type...

176
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:52,468
...with her breasts
hanging down like that.

177
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:56,014
Yes, I designed her
that way without being asked.

178
00:11:56,115 --> 00:12:03,988
And we're usually pressed for time,
so we tend to neglect those details...

179
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:07,490
...but everyone really stuck
to the script and designs.

180
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:11,825
I was so surprised...
The animation was so faithful.

181
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:20,567
They even kept the braless look!
That was really surprising.

182
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:26,541
And you know when different people
work on the same character...

183
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:31,582
...it can get inconsistent. But that
never happened with this show.

184
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:38,555
But when I was going over
the animation, I tweaked Kaim a lot.

185
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:41,091
Oh, so it did happen after all.

186
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:42,820
So it did.

187
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:48,967
But still, I think that
what we see onscreen...

188
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:53,232
...is largely what the character
designer had in mind.

189
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:56,570
You know that apron Mamina
was wearing just now?

190
00:12:56,675 --> 00:13:01,977
That was one of your requests...
To have her wear her own apron.

191
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:04,572
Right, her own apron.

192
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:08,815
She packed her
own apron to go to war!

193
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:12,755
This was what gave
Mamina's image a real boost.

194
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:14,792
Even though she
cooked those mice?

195
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:16,885
She's deceiving you, guys.

196
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:22,562
In this scene, what's Yun...

197
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:26,195
What exactly is she observing?

198
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:30,506
Uh, that's a mystery, isn't it?

199
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:36,709
Yun happens to be
very mature. She's an adult.

200
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:44,848
She's actually thinking,
"I never got to do anything like that."

201
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:47,617
Oh, is that so?

202
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:54,031
So Yun is imagining herself in
Floe's place as she's drinking juice.

203
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:55,395
That's right.

204
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,128
So she's daydreaming.

205
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:58,601
Right.

206
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:04,373
The thing about Yun is that she
never got to do anything she wanted.

207
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:09,111
I guess you could
say she led a sad life.

208
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:15,618
But because of her principles
and those gorgeous looks...

209
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:17,814
...people think highly of her.

210
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:24,185
So is she one of those people whose
suppressed affections are later...

211
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:27,925
Later in the story...
Do they, like, explode?

212
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,830
You could say that.

213
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:31,334
Really now?

214
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,736
Hey, I was about to discuss
the war, but look where we are now!

215
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:43,775
I did hear about this yesterday...

216
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:49,185
This war has been going on for about
50 years, growing out of skirmishes.

217
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:53,782
It's been going on
in some fashion for a long time.

218
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:59,627
Ever since Neviril's dad,
Harukonf-sama, went into battle...

219
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:03,224
Or rather, he'd take off in
a Simoun, intimidate the enemies...

220
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:05,462
...and come back to base.

221
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:12,241
Is it all right if I draw
Harukonf when he was a sibylla?

222
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:14,846
Okay.

223
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:16,380
All right!

224
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:23,018
Then we need him to guest
star in Simoun episode 37.

225
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,885
I'll let him know.

226
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:39,900
Well, anyway, a lot of story
development happens in this episode...

227
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:50,145
Those hand gestures and facial
expressions started here, right?

228
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,379
Creative decisions.

229
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:55,885
I looked at them every time
the revised drafts came in.

230
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:59,287
I'd heard that the climactic
scene of this episode...

231
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:03,418
...was when Anglas goes,
"Aer!" and then boom!

232
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:08,497
So I was wondering
how to fool our viewers.

233
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,864
Sinister passions were stirred.

234
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,303
While I was drawing those
cute facial expressions.

235
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:22,912
And this is the harmony here.

236
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,710
This priestess named Anglas...

237
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:32,050
Later on in the show, another
Plumbum highland priestess...

238
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,726
Whoa, hey! It's over!

239
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:34,259

Whoa, hey! It's over!

240
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:36,395

<i>Asako Nishida</i>
Way too short!

241
