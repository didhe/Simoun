1
00:00:01,434 --> 00:00:10,424
The countless flowers,
enveloped in light...

2
00:00:10,534 --> 00:00:21,044
...gaze at tomorrow
with unwavering eyes.

3
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:39,694
Everyone wishes for me to be pure...

4
00:00:40,304 --> 00:00:47,404
...but what can I bring
with me to the frayed skies?

5
00:00:47,504 --> 00:00:54,574
What I've made my own
by breaking off flowers in bloom...

6
00:00:54,884 --> 00:01:00,154
All such sinful things...

7
00:01:00,254 --> 00:01:07,624
Why did I stop making
promises with the future?

8
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:14,894
Because even if I try
to run far from all the pain...

9
00:01:15,004 --> 00:01:21,634
...a cold wind rustles
my hair... Don't you see?

10
00:01:21,744 --> 00:01:29,154
Where can I ever find the answer?

11
00:01:37,694 --> 00:01:38,524
It's the enemy!

12
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,864
They've spotted us!

13
00:01:45,964 --> 00:01:47,194
Retreat at full speed!

14
00:02:05,154 --> 00:02:08,384
The fact that the enemy Simouns
showed up in battle today...

15
00:02:08,454 --> 00:02:13,294
...was a taunt to let us know
they can attack us at any time.

16
00:02:13,864 --> 00:02:17,264
And that's exactly
what they're capable of.

17
00:02:22,234 --> 00:02:28,194
Eternal Maidens

18
00:03:29,934 --> 00:03:32,904
So it's really over now?

19
00:03:32,974 --> 00:03:34,444
The war, that is...

20
00:03:34,944 --> 00:03:35,914
Yes.

21
00:03:36,344 --> 00:03:40,714
So now we can finally devote our
lives to just offering prayers?

22
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:42,944
Yes.

23
00:03:43,454 --> 00:03:44,784
Yeah, but...

24
00:03:45,054 --> 00:03:47,384
Why is it that it doesn't
make us feel better?

25
00:04:11,144 --> 00:04:14,544
I want to see that other world.

26
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:24,454
The one that Grandpa was
always yearning to see.

27
00:04:24,924 --> 00:04:26,414
A different world than this one...

28
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:31,524
That's why I became a sibylla,
so I could get there!

29
00:04:32,134 --> 00:04:33,364
But now...

30
00:04:34,104 --> 00:04:35,034
Amuria...

31
00:04:35,034 --> 00:04:35,794
Amuria...
What?

32
00:04:36,274 --> 00:04:41,404
Then does that mean that Amuria
may also be alive somewhere?

33
00:04:50,984 --> 00:04:52,454
That won't do.

34
00:04:53,624 --> 00:04:55,454
Vice Chancellor?

35
00:04:55,994 --> 00:05:01,054
Please don't call me that.
That is no longer my title.

36
00:05:02,894 --> 00:05:06,834
Though its life may have ended...

37
00:05:07,104 --> 00:05:11,404
...this flower can still
provide solace at least.

38
00:05:17,044 --> 00:05:20,774
Didn't you attend the ceremony?

39
00:05:20,844 --> 00:05:21,834
No.

40
00:05:22,914 --> 00:05:25,014
The war has ended.

41
00:05:25,754 --> 00:05:27,914
And that means it's all over now.

42
00:05:28,754 --> 00:05:32,244
Still provide solace, did I say?

43
00:05:32,894 --> 00:05:35,924
But I no longer have the power to do so.

44
00:05:37,394 --> 00:05:40,764
I can no longer protect my Neviril.

45
00:05:40,764 --> 00:05:41,864
I can no longer protect my Neviril.
What?

46
00:05:43,604 --> 00:05:45,164
What did you say?

47
00:05:45,544 --> 00:05:47,234
Those are the two conditions set by...

48
00:05:47,304 --> 00:05:51,304
...Shoukoku and the Plumbum highlands
in exchange for the ceasefire.

49
00:05:51,414 --> 00:05:53,214
Nobody ever thought to inform me!

50
00:05:53,284 --> 00:05:57,444
We're to be treated as their
equals, if only on the surface.

51
00:05:57,514 --> 00:06:00,184
And just whose doing would that be?

52
00:06:00,784 --> 00:06:03,154
Think about it carefully.

53
00:06:03,224 --> 00:06:05,384
"War is foolishness..."

54
00:06:05,464 --> 00:06:08,914
Isn't that right, High Priestess?

55
00:06:16,034 --> 00:06:19,374
The military governors from
Plumbum and Shoukoku have arrived.

56
00:06:19,704 --> 00:06:21,834
Ah, we have been waiting for you...

57
00:06:36,024 --> 00:06:38,544
Is this really how
things should turn out?

58
00:06:38,624 --> 00:06:39,684
Yes.

59
00:06:40,224 --> 00:06:41,324
I...

60
00:06:42,164 --> 00:06:46,194
All I ever wanted was for the sibyllae
to continue praying to the skies.

61
00:06:46,264 --> 00:06:48,394
Nothing more...

62
00:06:49,104 --> 00:06:51,434
But with this change...

63
00:06:53,644 --> 00:06:54,904
Anubituf...

64
00:06:54,974 --> 00:06:57,464
The way the high priestess
was acting just now...

65
00:06:57,544 --> 00:06:58,574
What?

66
00:06:59,384 --> 00:07:00,544
Never mind.

67
00:07:08,354 --> 00:07:12,194
Why are they still around when
the peace ceremony is over?

68
00:07:12,264 --> 00:07:15,694
I heard that some of their forces
are staying on the Arcus Prima.

69
00:07:15,834 --> 00:07:19,594
The more I think of it, the less I
understand what this "peace" is about.

70
00:07:19,664 --> 00:07:21,434
There's nothing we can do about it.

71
00:07:21,504 --> 00:07:27,304
Until they found the ancient Simouns,
it was their comrades who were dying.

72
00:07:30,474 --> 00:07:32,744
So this is what they
look like in person.

73
00:07:35,684 --> 00:07:37,314
Roatreamon...

74
00:07:37,814 --> 00:07:41,274
All those faces that we
extinguished with our Ri Majons...

75
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:43,784
We never even knew
what they looked like.

76
00:07:43,894 --> 00:07:45,294
I'm sure...

77
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:46,724
I'm sure...

78
00:07:47,194 --> 00:07:49,024
...they didn't know what
we looked like either.

79
00:07:50,464 --> 00:07:52,954
Well, the food's
getting cold. Let's eat!

80
00:07:53,034 --> 00:07:55,764
Here, Roatreamon, have some of my fish.

81
00:07:55,834 --> 00:07:56,804
Excuse me?

82
00:07:57,004 --> 00:08:00,134
You're getting too thin, you know!
You have to get more nourishment.

83
00:08:00,204 --> 00:08:01,474
Right.

84
00:08:01,544 --> 00:08:02,904
Thank you!

85
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:05,884
Vura, you sound like her mom!

86
00:08:05,884 --> 00:08:07,404
Vura, you sound like her mom!
Do I?

87
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:11,174
Your legs are in the way!

88
00:08:11,254 --> 00:08:13,184
Get those filthy legs
of yours out of our way!

89
00:08:13,254 --> 00:08:16,284
Yeah, I know you can't understand
a word I'm saying, but...

90
00:08:16,354 --> 00:08:17,984
Foreign

91
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:21,954
Huh? I see that you
know I'm insulting you!

92
00:08:22,064 --> 00:08:23,584
Foreign

93
00:08:23,664 --> 00:08:25,964
Foreign

94
00:08:26,104 --> 00:08:27,534
Foreign

95
00:08:44,514 --> 00:08:45,714
You...

96
00:08:55,394 --> 00:08:58,854
Please forgive us,
Sibylla Aurea Neviril!

97
00:08:58,934 --> 00:09:01,734
We have committed an unspeakable sin!

98
00:09:02,434 --> 00:09:03,804
Neviril?

99
00:09:05,844 --> 00:09:07,774
I bless you. Go in peace...

100
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:09,744
Bless us?

101
00:09:11,214 --> 00:09:12,734
I bless you all...

102
00:09:41,104 --> 00:09:42,474
Neviril...

103
00:10:16,774 --> 00:10:18,374
Hey, you're in the shower too?

104
00:10:19,384 --> 00:10:20,314
Yes.

105
00:10:20,714 --> 00:10:22,304
Can I borrow your soap?

106
00:10:22,384 --> 00:10:23,374
Sure.

107
00:10:26,854 --> 00:10:29,754
Wow, yours are pretty huge, aren't they?

108
00:10:29,824 --> 00:10:30,984
What are?

109
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:33,954
They're always getting in my way.

110
00:10:34,024 --> 00:10:37,724
Oh, right. Because you're
going to become a man, right?

111
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:43,564
I have to become a man, or...

112
00:10:43,774 --> 00:10:45,534
I have to become strong, or...

113
00:10:46,004 --> 00:10:47,974
I can never protect what's dear to me.

114
00:10:48,044 --> 00:10:51,574
You know what? Neviril
told me something once...

115
00:10:55,014 --> 00:10:59,474
To become strong by being held...
You're wrong about that, Alty.

116
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:04,724
It's only when you've
both become strong...

117
00:11:05,224 --> 00:11:07,824
...that you can truly
hold each other close.

118
00:11:09,764 --> 00:11:11,024
I see...

119
00:11:12,134 --> 00:11:13,434
I see!

120
00:11:14,134 --> 00:11:17,124
I always thought I wanted
to become a man too.

121
00:11:17,234 --> 00:11:19,964
But now I think I can manage
without making that change.

122
00:11:29,214 --> 00:11:30,274
Big Sister...

123
00:11:34,084 --> 00:11:37,784
You should accept yourself as you
are. Your life will be easier then.

124
00:12:11,024 --> 00:12:12,284
Onasia!

125
00:12:12,624 --> 00:12:15,114
Onasia, how did you get here?

126
00:12:15,264 --> 00:12:17,854
I know you were at the Ruins,
so how in the world...

127
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:22,134
If you believed that to be true,
then why did you come here?

128
00:12:23,004 --> 00:12:24,304
Well...

129
00:12:25,204 --> 00:12:28,364
This is an extremely
unstable place to be.

130
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:32,944
The Ruins served as the
training grounds for Chor Dextra.

131
00:12:33,614 --> 00:12:39,314
So many abortive Emerald Ri Majons
exploded into oblivion there.

132
00:12:39,984 --> 00:12:42,044
The helical motors...

133
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:45,824
...are believed to
manipulate time and space.

134
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:47,284
Yes.

135
00:12:47,994 --> 00:12:50,434
And because of this, Space
and Time were distorted...

136
00:12:50,764 --> 00:12:55,324
...causing the Spring to exist
simultaneously in two different places.

137
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:59,174
I find all of this hard to believe.

138
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:05,644
There are very few things that
people can actually believe...

139
00:13:06,214 --> 00:13:11,654
...when they are unable
to believe in themselves.

140
00:13:17,694 --> 00:13:19,594
It's as you say.

141
00:13:19,664 --> 00:13:24,894
I wanted to be near my comrades
who had fallen in battle...

142
00:13:24,964 --> 00:13:29,404
...yet I was also trying to flee
as far away from them as possible.

143
00:13:29,704 --> 00:13:32,674
But how did you know that?

144
00:13:33,374 --> 00:13:35,434
Because I was the same way.

145
00:13:38,744 --> 00:13:41,874
I shied away from making a choice...

146
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:45,814
...and tried to run as far
away from reality as possible.

147
00:13:46,184 --> 00:13:50,354
Perhaps I've been seeking
you out all this time.

148
00:13:50,954 --> 00:13:52,584
Perhaps I wanted...

149
00:13:53,164 --> 00:13:56,324
...to have someone hear my confession.

150
00:13:56,694 --> 00:13:58,324
To hear...

151
00:14:00,704 --> 00:14:02,534
...my sins...

152
00:14:07,174 --> 00:14:11,204
One of the conditions of our peace
treaty with Plumbum and Shoukoku...

153
00:14:11,274 --> 00:14:14,374
...calls for the
dissolution of Chor Tempest.

154
00:14:36,034 --> 00:14:38,524
Where did Yun run off
to at a time like this?

155
00:14:38,604 --> 00:14:39,634
I know...

156
00:14:40,104 --> 00:14:41,544
I don't want any part of this!

157
00:14:41,604 --> 00:14:43,044
Roatreamon?

158
00:14:43,144 --> 00:14:45,574
Chor Tempest, disbanded?

159
00:14:46,514 --> 00:14:48,884
After all the effort we
put into it until now?

160
00:14:48,984 --> 00:14:53,424
The Plumbum priestesses will be
taking over our duties, right?

161
00:14:53,484 --> 00:14:56,324
I'm confused. Is this what peace is?

162
00:14:56,394 --> 00:14:59,124
We can never hope to be on equal terms.

163
00:14:59,194 --> 00:15:02,724
But I don't understand!

164
00:15:02,834 --> 00:15:05,564
One thing's for sure.

165
00:15:06,134 --> 00:15:11,904
They have no use for
us anymore. That's all.

166
00:15:18,744 --> 00:15:21,404
Just when we finally
started to understand...

167
00:15:21,484 --> 00:15:23,884
...the true meaning of
our prayers as sibyllae.

168
00:15:25,924 --> 00:15:28,384
Even after Chor Tempest
ceases to exist...

169
00:15:28,724 --> 00:15:32,454
...nothing can change the fact
that we're all Simoun sibyllae.

170
00:15:34,124 --> 00:15:38,464
And nobody will ever debase our prayers.

171
00:15:39,034 --> 00:15:40,154
Nobody!

172
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,054
If Chor Tempest is disbanded...

173
00:16:04,124 --> 00:16:06,114
Huh? What's this, all of a sudden?

174
00:16:06,194 --> 00:16:09,354
...we won't be able to
fly the Simouns anymore.

175
00:16:09,434 --> 00:16:11,524
The door to that other world...

176
00:16:12,334 --> 00:16:14,024
...will be closed to us.

177
00:16:14,634 --> 00:16:18,034
You've always longed to see
that other world, haven't you?

178
00:16:19,644 --> 00:16:20,804
In that case...

179
00:16:24,644 --> 00:16:27,514
I don't remember you being so talkative.

180
00:16:27,584 --> 00:16:28,704
What?

181
00:16:29,384 --> 00:16:30,354
Never mind.

182
00:16:30,414 --> 00:16:31,514
Aer!

183
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:37,784
Aer!

184
00:16:46,364 --> 00:16:49,924
We haven't talked like
this in a long time.

185
00:16:50,504 --> 00:16:51,494
No.

186
00:16:57,374 --> 00:16:58,364
Neviril...

187
00:16:58,444 --> 00:16:59,414
What?

188
00:17:00,314 --> 00:17:01,614
Would you...

189
00:17:02,284 --> 00:17:06,114
Would you give me your blessing too?

190
00:17:06,184 --> 00:17:07,274
What?

191
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:17,164
Of course I will!

192
00:17:18,234 --> 00:17:19,664
Neviril...

193
00:17:28,244 --> 00:17:29,174
Aer?

194
00:17:34,144 --> 00:17:36,044
What's going on? Sulking, are you?

195
00:17:37,354 --> 00:17:38,974
Did you have a fight with Neviril?

196
00:17:39,054 --> 00:17:41,854
Huh? Why are you
asking me about Neviril?

197
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:43,754
Right on the money, huh?

198
00:17:44,524 --> 00:17:45,754
Neviril...

199
00:17:46,564 --> 00:17:47,724
She's changed.

200
00:17:47,794 --> 00:17:49,314
What do you mean?

201
00:17:49,964 --> 00:17:51,294
She talks up a storm now.

202
00:17:51,494 --> 00:17:55,524
Well, you can always use
your mouth to stop her!

203
00:17:55,604 --> 00:17:57,764
Boy, kissing is all you
ever think about, Floe!

204
00:17:58,804 --> 00:18:02,174
You told me it's when you really like
someone that you want to kiss them.

205
00:18:02,244 --> 00:18:04,334
So don't you want to kiss her?

206
00:18:05,414 --> 00:18:07,434
Not the way Neviril is now.

207
00:18:08,244 --> 00:18:10,014
Don't you like her anymore?

208
00:18:14,484 --> 00:18:16,824
Ha! You're just jealous.

209
00:18:16,894 --> 00:18:19,654
No, I'm not! Huh?

210
00:18:20,094 --> 00:18:22,064
What's going on? I feel hot all over!

211
00:18:22,164 --> 00:18:23,964
Oh boy, you're in critical condition!

212
00:18:24,494 --> 00:18:27,194
Hold up! What do you mean, critical?

213
00:18:27,304 --> 00:18:29,424
It might not just be Neviril, you know?

214
00:18:29,874 --> 00:18:31,994
It could be that you've
changed as well, Aer.

215
00:18:52,794 --> 00:18:54,354
Sibylla Neviril!

216
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:57,484
Where is Sibylla Aer? Where is she?

217
00:18:57,964 --> 00:18:59,054
High Priestess!

218
00:18:59,134 --> 00:19:00,494
What is it, High Priestess?

219
00:19:02,234 --> 00:19:05,934
I suppose you'll do, Sibylla
Paraietta. Come with me!

220
00:19:06,004 --> 00:19:08,994
Follow me. Please. Hurry!

221
00:19:17,684 --> 00:19:18,744
High Priestess?

222
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,944
You must take off now, Sibylla
Paraietta, Sibylla Neviril!

223
00:19:22,024 --> 00:19:22,884
What?

224
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:26,754
There's no time to lose! You must
go at once! If you don't hurry...

225
00:19:27,424 --> 00:19:31,194
...the door will close on us!
Never to open again!

226
00:19:31,694 --> 00:19:32,994
The door?

227
00:19:35,934 --> 00:19:38,964
A long time ago...

228
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:41,774
...I was a member of Chor Dextra.

229
00:19:42,144 --> 00:19:43,264
What?

230
00:19:43,874 --> 00:19:46,574
I dreamed of completing
the Emerald Ri Majon.

231
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,774
I dreamed of becoming an eternal maiden.

232
00:19:50,254 --> 00:19:52,274
Eternal maiden?

233
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:55,454
A Simoun is much like a maiden herself.

234
00:19:55,724 --> 00:19:58,784
A maiden vacillates...

235
00:20:00,494 --> 00:20:03,794
The Simoun gem reflects
that vacillating soul.

236
00:20:04,194 --> 00:20:06,794
A maiden drifts...

237
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:10,294
Escaping reality for all eternity...

238
00:20:11,604 --> 00:20:17,234
Tracing the skies with
her everlasting beauty...

239
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,694
Please slow down, Your Eminence!

240
00:20:37,764 --> 00:20:39,634
The Emerald Ri Majon!

241
00:20:39,834 --> 00:20:43,364
You must change Kyuukoku's fate!
We cannot go on like this!

242
00:20:43,434 --> 00:20:44,994
Unless we do something about it, we...

243
00:20:45,474 --> 00:20:46,594
Foreign

244
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:48,234
Foreign

245
00:20:49,474 --> 00:20:51,704
Hurry! You must go now!

246
00:20:51,774 --> 00:20:53,334
To the Land of Hope!

247
00:20:53,414 --> 00:20:54,544
What?

248
00:20:54,914 --> 00:20:56,044
Foreign

249
00:21:00,484 --> 00:21:01,644
Foreign

250
00:21:01,724 --> 00:21:03,084
Foreign

251
00:21:20,944 --> 00:21:25,574
You're keeping something
from me, aren't you?

252
00:21:27,684 --> 00:21:29,544
I want to know what it is.

253
00:21:31,484 --> 00:21:32,684
But...

254
00:21:33,484 --> 00:21:37,044
I want to hold you.

255
00:21:38,894 --> 00:21:40,524
As your friend.

256
00:21:41,824 --> 00:21:43,454
Paraietta...

257
00:21:46,334 --> 00:21:48,324
Allow me to show you.

258
00:21:48,604 --> 00:21:51,264
When one flees from reality...

259
00:21:51,874 --> 00:21:54,364
...refusing to choose a gender...

260
00:21:54,704 --> 00:21:56,874
...this is what becomes of you.

261
00:22:41,854 --> 00:22:48,484
It is played by my wounds...
the song of prayer.

262
00:22:48,594 --> 00:22:52,724
Let it ring out over
the grieving universe.

263
00:22:52,834 --> 00:22:59,794
Can we change tomorrow?
Don't be afraid.

264
00:22:59,904 --> 00:23:07,474
I want to let you know
how my heart's overflowing.

265
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:20,284
I want to get closer to you.
I want to feel your pulse.

266
00:23:20,394 --> 00:23:25,454
I was too defiant,
and I took the long way around.

267
00:23:25,564 --> 00:23:29,434
The blue moon is swaying silently.

268
00:23:29,534 --> 00:23:33,474
My true heart's desire is you.

269
00:23:33,574 --> 00:23:39,344
I can't reach you.
My tears of pain trickle down.

270
00:23:39,444 --> 00:23:44,884
Soar away into the sky, song of prayer.

271
00:23:44,984 --> 00:23:48,314
Carrying my love that came too late.

272
00:23:48,424 --> 00:23:53,984
What can I do to change tomorrow?

273
00:23:54,094 --> 00:24:00,294
Just hold on to "now" the way it is...

274
00:24:05,704 --> 00:24:07,334
To Be Continued

275
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:11,244
Neviril bares her soul to Aer...

276
00:24:11,414 --> 00:24:14,314
...and the other sibyllae make
their way towards the Spring.

277
00:24:15,214 --> 00:24:17,154
Next time on Simoun...

278
00:24:17,384 --> 00:24:20,684
Choices
Choices.
