1
00:00:01,803 --> 00:00:10,803
The countless flowers,
enveloped in light...

2
00:00:10,913 --> 00:00:21,653
...gaze at tomorrow
with unwavering eyes.

3
00:00:33,443 --> 00:00:40,373
Everyone wishes for me to be pure...

4
00:00:40,683 --> 00:00:47,783
...but what can I bring
with me to the frayed skies?

5
00:00:47,883 --> 00:00:54,953
What I've made my own
by breaking off flowers in bloom...

6
00:00:55,263 --> 00:01:00,563
All such sinful things...

7
00:01:00,663 --> 00:01:08,003
Why did I stop making
promises with the future?

8
00:01:08,103 --> 00:01:15,313
Because even if I try
to run far from all the pain...

9
00:01:15,413 --> 00:01:22,013
...a cold wind rustles
my hair... Don't you see?

10
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:29,323
Where can I ever find the answer?

11
00:01:46,683 --> 00:01:48,643
Bell Ri Majon!

12
00:01:52,753 --> 00:01:54,243
Let's go, Kaim!

13
00:01:54,353 --> 00:01:56,053
Right, Para-sama.

14
00:02:12,103 --> 00:02:14,663
Rimone! You're going off course!

15
00:02:18,573 --> 00:02:19,703
They failed.

16
00:02:22,883 --> 00:02:24,143
We failed again?

17
00:02:24,253 --> 00:02:26,553
I won't let them get away!

18
00:02:37,393 --> 00:02:38,493
You did it!

19
00:02:41,803 --> 00:02:46,003
Those two have been weird since
that day. Did something happen...

20
00:02:50,143 --> 00:02:52,443
That was so Rimone's fault.

21
00:02:52,543 --> 00:02:55,743
And after they let her in
for being some genius.

22
00:02:55,853 --> 00:02:56,833
Floe...

23
00:02:56,953 --> 00:02:59,513
This isn't fair to Aer.

24
00:03:11,563 --> 00:03:17,523
White Loneliness

25
00:03:25,213 --> 00:03:29,843
Chor Tempest may be back on
active duty, but in that condition...

26
00:03:29,953 --> 00:03:33,043
That's Chor Tempest's current state.

27
00:03:33,823 --> 00:03:38,623
Can you give us your perspective
as Chor Dextra's sole survivor?

28
00:03:40,223 --> 00:03:43,823
Granted, we're not in
a position to be optimistic.

29
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:48,633
It's quite clear that this isn't the same
unit known as the "elite" chor.

30
00:03:48,903 --> 00:03:52,603
At their current strength,
the afternoon shift is their best.

31
00:03:52,703 --> 00:03:55,833
It seems they can't
return to night shift soon.

32
00:03:55,943 --> 00:03:58,463
The team needs urgent rebuilding.

33
00:03:58,573 --> 00:04:01,203
That's why I summoned you.

34
00:04:01,313 --> 00:04:04,013
Can you do it, Sibylla Dominüra?

35
00:04:05,283 --> 00:04:07,653
That's why I came after all.

36
00:04:08,383 --> 00:04:11,413
Let's get moving!
We're checking the helical motors!

37
00:04:11,523 --> 00:04:13,963
Don't forget to reload the ammo!

38
00:04:17,533 --> 00:04:19,963
Look here, Rimone,
what are you doing?

39
00:04:20,663 --> 00:04:22,893
Stop dragging Aer down.

40
00:04:23,003 --> 00:04:25,973
If you're not motivated,
why don't you quit?

41
00:04:26,073 --> 00:04:29,203
I'm here because
they told me to come.

42
00:04:29,973 --> 00:04:31,443
Listen, you!

43
00:04:32,913 --> 00:04:33,933
That's...

44
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:36,453
You must be the new arrival.

45
00:04:36,853 --> 00:04:39,313
Your name's... Dominüra?

46
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:46,963
So you're Rimone.

47
00:04:59,203 --> 00:05:00,793
Sibylla Rimone...

48
00:05:00,903 --> 00:05:04,963
During your trainee days, your
talents were asserted to the fullest.

49
00:05:05,643 --> 00:05:08,473
Since training school,
you've rewritten record books...

50
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:14,483
...as the youngest achiever in written
and practical exams, the top sagitta.

51
00:05:15,253 --> 00:05:19,783
Afterwards, recognizing your skills,
the powers that be assigned you...

52
00:05:19,893 --> 00:05:25,833
...the youngest sibylla, to Chor Tempest
as an exception among exceptions.

53
00:05:25,933 --> 00:05:28,733
Combat experience... zero.

54
00:05:29,433 --> 00:05:32,833
You mobilized without
permission the other day...

55
00:05:32,943 --> 00:05:34,563
How...

56
00:05:35,143 --> 00:05:36,833
Because I was interested.

57
00:05:39,613 --> 00:05:43,553
You don't need me to tell
you that your dossier is ideal.

58
00:05:43,653 --> 00:05:46,743
At least until Chor Tempest fell apart.

59
00:05:47,423 --> 00:05:49,853
You're feeling hesitant, aren't you?

60
00:05:49,953 --> 00:05:54,953
After all, who ever thought
you'd turn into a sibylla like this?

61
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,793
What are you saying?

62
00:05:56,893 --> 00:05:59,493
I'm the one who can save you.

63
00:06:01,933 --> 00:06:03,903
Trust me, dear.

64
00:06:04,003 --> 00:06:06,703
Just do as I tell you.

65
00:06:07,203 --> 00:06:10,003
Then you can
return to your past glory.

66
00:06:11,213 --> 00:06:14,513
Back to the peak
where prodigies belong.

67
00:06:15,543 --> 00:06:21,543
It seems Dominüra plans to rebuild
Chor Tempest with Rimone at its core.

68
00:06:21,983 --> 00:06:26,653
Well, chor matters are your domain.
I have no clue about them.

69
00:06:26,763 --> 00:06:28,023
No clue?

70
00:06:28,363 --> 00:06:30,123
Just think.

71
00:06:30,233 --> 00:06:34,063
What are those highly
emotional sibyllae thinking?

72
00:06:34,163 --> 00:06:37,193
It's far beyond the grasp of us adults.

73
00:06:37,933 --> 00:06:42,463
We can't even begin to understand
how the youngest sibylla feels...

74
00:06:42,573 --> 00:06:45,273
How presumptuous would that be?

75
00:06:46,483 --> 00:06:49,143
Guragief, let me say one thing.

76
00:06:49,253 --> 00:06:50,273
What?

77
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:55,783
What we're dealing with now is a war.

78
00:06:56,953 --> 00:06:59,423
Even children can sense that.

79
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,293
Who is it?

80
00:07:35,263 --> 00:07:38,233
I didn't expect you to show up here.

81
00:07:40,003 --> 00:07:47,133
Um, if I said I wanted to dissolve
our pair, what would you think, Aer?

82
00:07:47,243 --> 00:07:48,733
I wouldn't mind.

83
00:07:49,143 --> 00:07:53,233
If that's what you really want,
Rimone, I'm fine with it.

84
00:07:54,413 --> 00:07:56,843
It's not as though I...

85
00:07:56,953 --> 00:07:58,473
Is that all?

86
00:08:00,953 --> 00:08:04,753
If only these hands on
the flight stick could be removed...

87
00:08:06,193 --> 00:08:07,823
It can't be helped...

88
00:08:07,923 --> 00:08:09,723
It can't be helped.

89
00:08:11,133 --> 00:08:14,193
Rimone, you can
go over there till I'm done.

90
00:08:14,303 --> 00:08:16,593
Hurry! Go over there!

91
00:08:21,673 --> 00:08:25,633
I've never made any
choices on my own till now.

92
00:08:26,183 --> 00:08:30,013
I've always done
whatever others told me to do.

93
00:08:30,113 --> 00:08:32,983
And the next thing I knew, I was here.

94
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:36,383
So I'd like you to decide for me, Aer.

95
00:08:36,493 --> 00:08:40,293
Does that mean you'd kill
someone if you were told to?

96
00:08:41,193 --> 00:08:43,183
I don't know...

97
00:08:43,393 --> 00:08:46,663
I won't tell you
what to do. Not anything.

98
00:08:48,263 --> 00:08:51,463
I'm here because
I chose not to make choices.

99
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:55,873
If you're scared of fighting,
you should quit being a sibylla.

100
00:08:55,973 --> 00:09:00,673
If you want to stay here,
you have to keep flying a Simoun.

101
00:09:04,013 --> 00:09:08,183
If you really have no reason to be
here, quitting's the only choice.

102
00:09:22,633 --> 00:09:23,893
Why?

103
00:09:31,673 --> 00:09:34,973
Rimone, you're wonderfully talented.

104
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:38,743
I'm sure you can become
an amazing Simoun sibylla.

105
00:09:42,823 --> 00:09:44,913
Rimone, match your partner!

106
00:09:45,023 --> 00:09:48,963
Because there isn't anyone
who can keep up with you.

107
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,093
You're still a child!

108
00:09:52,193 --> 00:09:55,653
Don't butt in just because
you have a little talent!

109
00:10:00,673 --> 00:10:02,263
I'm just...

110
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:16,783
Why have you stopped
flying Simouns, Sibylla Aurea?

111
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:20,223
Are you afraid?

112
00:10:20,323 --> 00:10:21,723
That's not it.

113
00:10:22,363 --> 00:10:25,493
It's just that right now, I...

114
00:10:28,233 --> 00:10:33,103
Sibylla Aurea...
what are we all here for?

115
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:36,103
You...

116
00:10:37,343 --> 00:10:39,863
You should know the answer.

117
00:10:39,983 --> 00:10:42,143
Please tell me...

118
00:10:47,483 --> 00:10:51,113
As I am now, I can't possibly help you.

119
00:10:56,033 --> 00:10:57,323
Rimone!

120
00:11:14,743 --> 00:11:16,473
After all that...

121
00:11:52,513 --> 00:11:56,513
After all that,
nothing's changed for me at all.

122
00:12:15,003 --> 00:12:16,563
Scout their strength?

123
00:12:16,673 --> 00:12:21,173
It seems there's word of
significant military action in the north.

124
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:24,113
In the north?
The Plumbum highlands?

125
00:12:24,213 --> 00:12:29,783
Or rather, it's a chance to see
Dominüra and Rimone's compatibility.

126
00:12:29,893 --> 00:12:33,883
They're sending those
two along with Floe and Alty.

127
00:12:33,993 --> 00:12:36,513
Have those two paired up?

128
00:12:37,133 --> 00:12:42,033
They say it was Dominüra's decision.
I wonder what kind of person she is?

129
00:12:46,073 --> 00:12:47,803
Wait, Rimone.

130
00:12:49,373 --> 00:12:51,643
This is where you're sitting.

131
00:12:55,043 --> 00:12:56,643
I'm the auriga?

132
00:12:56,753 --> 00:12:59,713
Right. This is where you belong.

133
00:12:59,823 --> 00:13:00,983
But...

134
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:03,883
I know.

135
00:13:04,453 --> 00:13:07,223
I'm doing this for your own good.

136
00:13:07,323 --> 00:13:08,853
Despite that?

137
00:13:08,963 --> 00:13:10,793
That's precisely why.

138
00:13:12,493 --> 00:13:14,053
Since that incident...

139
00:13:14,163 --> 00:13:18,833
...you've been subconsciously holding
back your abilities. Release them.

140
00:13:18,933 --> 00:13:23,633
Didn't I tell you? No one
knows more about you than me.

141
00:13:23,743 --> 00:13:25,143
Trust me.

142
00:13:26,313 --> 00:13:29,283
If you do, everything will turn out fine.

143
00:13:54,143 --> 00:13:56,603
She made Rimone the auriga.

144
00:13:57,073 --> 00:13:59,873
I guess she's giving it some thought.

145
00:14:08,283 --> 00:14:10,953
Well? Are you starting to get the feel?

146
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:26,363
Arriving at target destination shortly.
Maintain contact as we start scouting.

147
00:14:26,473 --> 00:14:27,773
Roger.

148
00:14:40,983 --> 00:14:43,283
So let's hear it, Rimone.

149
00:14:44,653 --> 00:14:48,923
Are you up to the job of auriga?
Or are you being a pushover again?

150
00:14:49,023 --> 00:14:52,053
There's to be
no talking during the operation.

151
00:14:52,163 --> 00:14:55,653
Also, never ask Rimone
questions like that.

152
00:14:55,763 --> 00:14:57,233
Yes, ma'am.

153
00:15:07,113 --> 00:15:08,133
It's snowing.

154
00:15:14,483 --> 00:15:16,853
No wonder it's so chilly.

155
00:15:24,193 --> 00:15:26,493
Right wing, no sign of aircraft.

156
00:15:27,403 --> 00:15:30,393
Likewise, no sign of aircraft ahead.

157
00:15:48,553 --> 00:15:50,283
Enemy at three o'clock!

158
00:16:07,303 --> 00:16:08,533
There's a lot!

159
00:16:22,353 --> 00:16:24,323
Let's go too, Rimone.

160
00:16:25,453 --> 00:16:26,683
Rimone!

161
00:16:32,663 --> 00:16:34,063
Rimone!

162
00:16:38,233 --> 00:16:41,933
Stop it, Rimone! A sudden
Silver Ri Majon is too risky!

163
00:16:42,373 --> 00:16:43,673
No, we can.

164
00:16:43,773 --> 00:16:46,943
It's not possible! Just do as I say!

165
00:16:52,883 --> 00:16:54,443
We can do it.

166
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:00,953
It's simple.

167
00:17:17,173 --> 00:17:20,273
Your trainee days still haunt you?

168
00:17:28,823 --> 00:17:30,983
Not good. All this snow...

169
00:17:31,493 --> 00:17:32,983
This snowstorm!

170
00:17:43,473 --> 00:17:47,803
They're late... They should've
been back a long time ago.

171
00:18:00,683 --> 00:18:03,523
Oh! Who knew there were so many?

172
00:18:04,753 --> 00:18:06,483
What do we do?

173
00:18:06,593 --> 00:18:11,033
We can barely fly straight in this
snowstorm, let alone try a Ri Majon.

174
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:17,033
It's hard enough for us...
but those two just paired up.

175
00:18:17,433 --> 00:18:21,603
Rimone, we're retreating. There's
no point if we can't do a Ri Majon.

176
00:18:21,703 --> 00:18:23,533
Our mission is scouting.

177
00:18:23,643 --> 00:18:26,273
We'll regroup and come back later!

178
00:18:28,243 --> 00:18:30,303
Rimone, answer me!

179
00:18:37,393 --> 00:18:38,443
Rimone!

180
00:18:40,063 --> 00:18:41,023
Aer.

181
00:18:51,773 --> 00:18:53,433
Why did you come?

182
00:18:53,543 --> 00:18:57,033
You were so late we came
to pick you up. Situation?

183
00:18:57,143 --> 00:18:58,803
We're about to retreat.

184
00:18:59,443 --> 00:19:00,673
Rimone!

185
00:19:03,013 --> 00:19:05,383
What should we do, Rimone?

186
00:19:05,483 --> 00:19:06,573
I...

187
00:19:07,553 --> 00:19:10,283
Rimone! Do as I say!

188
00:19:12,823 --> 00:19:14,953
Make up your own mind.

189
00:19:18,093 --> 00:19:20,723
Or are you being a pushover again?

190
00:19:34,013 --> 00:19:35,243
Rimone!

191
00:19:40,383 --> 00:19:42,323
Silver Ri Majon.

192
00:19:42,423 --> 00:19:43,883
Rimone!

193
00:19:43,993 --> 00:19:45,853
Aer, together?

194
00:19:45,953 --> 00:19:47,793
Roger! Go for it!

195
00:19:47,893 --> 00:19:52,423
It's suicidal! In these conditions...
And it needs several Simouns!

196
00:19:53,203 --> 00:19:55,193
Silver Ri Majon!

197
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,713
It won't work! Disengage!

198
00:20:38,343 --> 00:20:41,473
That's right...
What I wanted to achieve...

199
00:20:45,813 --> 00:20:49,313
...was a Ri Majon more
perfect than anyone else's.

200
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:37,393
Did we do it?
Did we destroy those enemy tanks?

201
00:22:16,173 --> 00:22:18,443
She's a genius after all.

202
00:22:20,143 --> 00:22:22,943
I was right about her all along.

203
00:22:42,263 --> 00:22:48,903
It is played by my wounds...
the song of prayer.

204
00:22:49,003 --> 00:22:53,133
Let it ring out over
the grieving universe.

205
00:22:53,243 --> 00:23:00,173
Can we change tomorrow?
Don't be afraid.

206
00:23:00,283 --> 00:23:08,253
I want to let you know
how my heart's overflowing.

207
00:23:16,703 --> 00:23:20,693
"I want to get closer to you."
"I want to feel your pulse."

208
00:23:20,803 --> 00:23:25,873
I was too defiant,
and I took the long way around.

209
00:23:25,973 --> 00:23:29,843
The blue moon is swaying silently.

210
00:23:29,953 --> 00:23:33,883
My true heart's desire is you.

211
00:23:33,983 --> 00:23:39,753
I can't reach you.
My tears of pain trickle down.

212
00:23:39,853 --> 00:23:45,293
Soar away into the sky, song of prayer.

213
00:23:45,393 --> 00:23:48,763
Carrying my love that came too late.

214
00:23:48,863 --> 00:23:54,393
What can I do to change tomorrow?

215
00:23:54,503 --> 00:24:00,743
Just hold on to "now" the way it is...

216
00:24:06,453 --> 00:24:07,283
To Be Continued

217
00:24:07,283 --> 00:24:07,683
To Be Continued
I'm Kaim, Sibylla Paraietta's...

218
00:24:07,683 --> 00:24:10,713
I'm Kaim, Sibylla Paraietta's...

219
00:24:10,823 --> 00:24:12,883
Para-sama's pair.

220
00:24:15,563 --> 00:24:16,523
Next time on Simoun...

221
00:24:16,523 --> 00:24:17,433
Wounds and Pain
Next time on Simoun...

222
00:24:17,433 --> 00:24:20,993
Wounds and Pain
Wounds and Pain.
