1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:09,730
The countless flowers,
enveloped in light...

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:20,340
...gaze at tomorrow
with unwavering eyes.

3
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:38,990
Everyone wishes for me to be pure...

4
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:46,700
...but what can I bring
with me to the frayed skies?

5
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:53,870
What I've made my own
by breaking off flowers in bloom...

6
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:59,450
All such sinful things...

7
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:06,930
Why did I stop making
promises with the future?

8
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:14,200
Because even if I try
to run far from all the pain...

9
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:20,940
...a cold wind rustles
my hair... Don't you see?

10
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:28,450
Where can I ever find the answer?

11
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,430
Hold on!

12
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:39,490
Big Sister...

13
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,400
I'm Para-sama's pair! You can't
just tell me to team up with Alty now.

14
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,230
Regarding Paraietta,
you can easily be replaced.

15
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,940
But no one can take
your place as sisters.

16
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,570
The Ri Majon you inscribe will show
some interesting results, I'm sure.

17
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,910
Sisters?

18
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,850
This is all for the sake of restoring
Chor Tempest to its former prestige.

19
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,420
We simply can't
afford another fiasco.

20
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:17,920
Sisters

21
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,930
Yun!

22
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:24,530
I can't believe you're pushing away
such tiny bits of onion like that!

23
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,400
Leave me alone.

24
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,850
Yun, I didn't know
you could be so cute!

25
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,910
So it really wasn't
such a big deal, huh?

26
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:39,980
Saying how in love you were, but
that's how much you care in the end.

27
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,260
Mastiff! You're so sweet!

28
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,420
Mastiff! You're so sweet!
Killing other people...

29
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,490
Kaim.

30
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:50,330
What? Don't lash out just because
your beloved Para-sama dumped you.

31
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,520
Wha...

32
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,360
Stop it right now!

33
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,750
Big Sister...

34
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:23,160
Oh, they're finally back to normal now.

35
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:27,190
Really... Putting up with
such barbarous treatment...

36
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,670
I'm proud of you!

37
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:33,210
Morinas, I can't let you get away
with using the word "barbarous."

38
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,240
Hey... That's unusual.

39
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,290
Floe...

40
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,990
Sorry.

41
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:03,260
My sister didn't mean to hurt you.

42
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:04,740
It's just that...

43
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,330
It's just that...
It's all right.

44
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,530
Because she's right
about how much I care.

45
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:16,180
I felt... like I was going
to burst inside, see...

46
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,820
I thought my heart
was just going to stop...

47
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,290
And yet...

48
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,320
It didn't stop.

49
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,820
But the thing is...

50
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,570
I just don't want to ever
forget about that night.

51
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,060
That's how I feel.

52
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:45,010
Not to forget... about that night...

53
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,670
Big Sister...

54
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,420
Come on, Floe. Left more.

55
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:06,270
Why's this boat leaking like this?

56
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:10,900
I'm sure the Messis is quite pleased
having Simoun sibyllae help out.

57
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,900
Unbelievable. I don't see how it flies.

58
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,600
My apologies.

59
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:16,800
Where's Kaim?

60
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:20,140
Still sulking.
She really is a pain in the butt.

61
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,650
There you are.

62
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:31,060
Kaim, about tomorrow's test flight...

63
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,650
They've decided to send Aer
and myself to accompany you.

64
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,460
Don't you even care, Para-sama?
That I'm not your pair anymore?

65
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,000
Calm down, Kaim.

66
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,560
Don't look at me like that!

67
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,630
I'm sorry.

68
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,430
It's not your fault.

69
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,670
Kaim...

70
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,270
But it's not my fault either!

71
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:53,940
Kaim!

72
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,520
She seems so upset.

73
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,450
Maybe I should've
at least accompanied her.

74
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,190
It wouldn't do any good for you to go.

75
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,570
Man, you busted it!

76
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:32,010
Freezing! Jeez, we got rid of the rusty
water, and now there's no hot water?

77
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,590
What a bummer.

78
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,190
Isn't that water cold?

79
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,760
It won't wash off.

80
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,290
I scrub and scrub...

81
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,700
But no matter how much...

82
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,960
...it just won't wash off.

83
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,120
Let's get some sleep now.

84
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:13,090
Rimone, aren't you scared?

85
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:15,390
You can come over to my bed.

86
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:16,990
I'm okay.

87
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,030
You don't have to be brave.
After all, you're still little...

88
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:22,760
The truth is you're
the one who's scared.

89
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,630
T-That's not true...

90
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:45,650
Proof that an eternal world exists...

91
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:53,130
...shall be revealed
by Tempus Spatium.

92
00:07:53,730 --> 00:08:01,870
Rocking gently
until we awake tomorrow...

93
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,640
...protected by our mother.

94
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,870
What's the matter?

95
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:03,200
Nothing.

96
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,020
This is the first time, isn't it?
That we've flown together.

97
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,930
It's called "praying to the skies."

98
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,860
Big Sister... How did
we ever come to this?

99
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,530
We used to always do things together.

100
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,280
It was that night...

101
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,310
Shut up!

102
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,780
Aer, after them!

103
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,330
Aer, the communication cable!

104
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,670
Right.

105
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:49,900
Neviril, look!

106
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,940
What's happening?

107
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,120
Kaim! Alty!

108
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:05,980
Why? Why aren't their prayers
being heard by the Simoun gem?

109
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,090
They're in the clouds...

110
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,000
I won't lose them.

111
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:17,660
Big Sister!

112
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,570
Don't call me that!

113
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,570
Big Sister!

114
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,110
I said stop calling me that!

115
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:34,110
I was right after all.

116
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:38,560
You were to blame after all.

117
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,630
Alty... It's all your fault.

118
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:45,130
That's right... It was all...

119
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,360
It was all because of you!

120
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,780
What could that be?

121
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:47,160
Wow... it's as
dilapidated as the Messis.

122
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:49,820
Still, what the heck is it?

123
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:52,400
It's Shoukoku's aerial base.

124
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,970
But who would've thought
a base this size even existed?

125
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:02,530
They don't seem to have spotted us,
even though we're so close.

126
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,240
Shall we explore?

127
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:09,940
No, it's risky. With the other Simoun's
oddness, let's return to the Messis...

128
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:14,490
It was useless from the start. Even
Dominüra should be able to see that.

129
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:17,060
We may be sisters, but still...

130
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,720
I'm going.

131
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,460
Alty?

132
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:32,470
I'll show Dominüra that it's
not impossible for us to be a team.

133
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:39,210
Leave it to me.
Aer and Kaim will wait in the Simouns.

134
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:42,850
We'll approach at a slow
pace and then move in.

135
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,920
If something happens...

136
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,220
It looks deserted.

137
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:27,660
You're right.

138
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,690
What's that?

139
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,060
A broken searchlight...

140
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:37,470
A base left unguarded...

141
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:42,300
So we're suffering at the hands
of people like this, aren't we?

142
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:43,470
Yes.

143
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:48,340
How can they even confront
our divine vessels in battle?

144
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:51,510
Maybe it's not a matter
of who's more powerful...

145
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,020
Do you think they're not afraid to die?

146
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,220
I don't think there's
anyone who isn't afraid to die.

147
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:00,320
Then they must be strong.

148
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,720
I'm envious.

149
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,230
Alty...

150
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,480
There's no need to be
the strong one all on your own.

151
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,740
It's all Alty's fault. That girl's always...

152
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,210
...always getting in my way.

153
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,720
But why?

154
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,990
Why does she always...

155
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:31,660
What happened
between you and Alty?

156
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:37,030
You two have this really weird vibe...
Even though you're sisters.

157
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,460
It's because we are sisters.

158
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,700
That night...

159
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:55,210
That night, I was feeling vulnerable.

160
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:59,420
I'd be going into my
first battle in the morning.

161
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:03,960
And I was scared. I wanted
to scream. I wanted to run away.

162
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,220
At that moment...

163
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:14,830
She took advantage of me.

164
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,370
I couldn't say no to her.

165
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:19,770
When Alty seduced me...

166
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,640
I don't really get it.

167
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:30,810
I don't blame you.
For sisters, it's an abominable sin.

168
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,890
That's not what I'm talking about.

169
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:36,860
Is it really a matter of who
was right and who was wrong?

170
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,590
But of course...

171
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:43,860
I can't tell from just hearing this.
Maybe you really did the seducing.

172
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,860
Seduced her? Me?

173
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,990
I seduced her? That's not possible.

174
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,380
I couldn't have...

175
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:12,880
Kaim?

176
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:16,260
I've got to make sure.

177
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,700
I've got to bring Alty back.

178
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,220
I've got to bring Alty back.
Hold on, Kaim!

179
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,390
Kaim!

180
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:31,600
When we were little,
I was always a little crybaby...

181
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:35,020
And whenever I cried...

182
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:38,640
...Big Sister would
always hold me close.

183
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,660
And I became stronger.

184
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:56,070
What I'd like to go back to isn't that
night but a warm, cozy afternoon.

185
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:04,010
What I want isn't the hand that
taught me sensations I'd never known.

186
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:08,370
It's the gentle hand that
held mine as we walked.

187
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,610
But... Big Sister...

188
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:18,280
I want to become a man someday...

189
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:21,120
So that next time,
I can hold her close.

190
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:24,890
To hold Big Sister tight...

191
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,330
Big Sister!

192
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:57,760
Big Sister!

193
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:06,940
Big Sister! Jump!

194
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,340
Big Sister, what's the matter?
You don't have to worry!

195
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:18,080
Because I'll catch you
and hold you close!

196
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,680
Big Sister!

197
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:33,360
It's not my fault...

198
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:55,310
Kaim, as soon as we land,
act as Aer's sagitta.

199
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,890
Kaim! Got it?

200
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,350
Yes.

201
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:38,690
The Simoun gem was
unaffected by their prayers?

202
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:43,290
I see... Have you ever heard
of that happening before?

203
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,060
No, never.

204
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:50,770
As for Shoukoku's aerial base,
we can't very well ignore it.

205
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,010
Apparently there's a new
class of aircraft on that base.

206
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:07,850
To become strong by being held...
You're wrong about that, Alty.

207
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:13,100
It's only when you've
both become strong...

208
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:16,560
...that you can truly
hold each other close.

209
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,340
Aer, is my sister all right?

210
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,640
It was just a scrape.

211
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,870
Thanks.

212
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:34,220
Hey, you never got
to hold Amuria close, did you?

213
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,720
Don't worry. It'll happen with us.

214
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,530
The person you're
looking at right now...

215
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,800
...is someone who will never
grow old, and it's you yourself.

216
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,740
It's not me.

217
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:34,540
The same taste.

218
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:47,750
It is played by my wounds...
the song of prayer.

219
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:51,990
Let it ring out over
the grieving universe.

220
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:59,060
Can we change tomorrow?
Don't be afraid.

221
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:06,740
I want to let you know
how my heart's overflowing.

222
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:19,550
"I want to get closer to you."
"I want to feel your pulse."

223
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:24,720
I was too defiant,
and I took the long way around.

224
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:28,700
The blue moon is swaying silently.

225
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,740
My true heart's desire is you.

226
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:38,610
I can't reach you.
My tears of pain trickle down.

227
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:44,150
Soar away into the sky, song of prayer.

228
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:47,580
Carrying my love that came too late.

229
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:53,250
What can I do to change tomorrow?

230
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:59,560
Just hold on to "now" the way it is...

231
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:06,570
To Be Continued

232
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:11,880
Neviril screams, losing her
head over something Aer says.

233
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,450
Next time on Simoun...

234
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:16,520
Reason
Next time on Simoun...

235
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,120
Reason

236
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,690
Reason
Reason.

237
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:19,910
Reason
