1
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:15,680
The countless flowers,
enveloped in light...

2
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:26,480
...gaze at tomorrow
with unwavering eyes.

3
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:45,070
Everyone wishes for me to be pure...

4
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:52,640
...but what can I bring
with me to the frayed skies?

5
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:59,910
What I've made my own
by breaking off flowers in bloom...

6
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:05,520
All such sinful things...

7
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:13,000
Why did I stop making
promises with the future?

8
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:20,270
Because even if I try
to run far from all the pain...

9
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:26,840
...a cold wind rustles
my hair... Don't you see?

10
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:34,280
Where can I ever find the answer?

11
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,140
The technology
in my country, Shoukoku...

12
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,970
...is the most
cutting edge in Daikuuriku.

13
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:37,680
Even so, we still can't build a plane
that can fly above the clouds...

14
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:43,090
...and if lightning struck the gas tank,
it would instantly explode into flames.

15
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:47,050
We're aware of
this danger but must go forth.

16
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,800
Beyond the waves' crests...

17
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,120
Kyuukoku.

18
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:16,350
This sublime and peaceful
country carries a certain secret.

19
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:22,800
To gain this secret, my country
has mounted countless invasions.

20
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,660
But we have always been thwarted.

21
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,910
Kyuukoku's secret.

22
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,650
The demonic Simoun.

23
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:50,250
No other vessel in Daikuuriku
is capable of flying so freely...

24
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,330
Fallen Wings
...throughout the skies.

25
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:56,290
Fallen Wings

26
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,620
It's a routine patrol flight.

27
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,630
The governors are observing today,
so they're making a show of it.

28
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,550
Neviril-sama...

29
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,650
Neviril-sama...
Call her "Sibylla Aurea."

30
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,280
She glitters like gold...

31
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,970
Was your father well, Neviril?

32
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,010
Amuria, you're tormenting me.

33
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,320
There are hundreds
of Ri Majon patterns...

34
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:02,050
...and depending on the mix,
they take infinite shapes.

35
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,620
We've forgotten what many
of those patterns signify...

36
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:10,390
...but the Simoun sibyllae are
always prepared to rediscover them.

37
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:15,060
Your daughter is
an outstanding pilot, as expected.

38
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,870
It seems she's become a
full-fledged pilot, which relieves me.

39
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:24,240
Indeed, she's become the premier
Simoun sibylla called "Sibylla Aurea."

40
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:27,340
Her prayers may
indeed be exceptional...

41
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:31,910
...but if she's used in war,
we're only tarnishing an old tradition.

42
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,150
High Priestess...

43
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:37,420
How can we use prayers meant
only for the gods for war?

44
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:42,700
By deploying Simouns to the border,
we display Tempus Spatium's power...

45
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:47,670
...and can repulse these nefarious
invaders in a peaceful manner.

46
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,900
Is that not
in accordance with God's will?

47
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:08,220
My father made a point of ordering
Chor Tempest to mobilize...

48
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:11,520
...since he wanted to look
good for the spectators.

49
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:14,360
It's because Chor Tempest
is the best chor.

50
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:19,190
Amuria, it's not becoming of
a sibylla to use the word "best."

51
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,290
You're wrong.

52
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:25,270
We're only offering up our prayers.

53
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:30,240
By achieving a perfect Ri Majon,
we give comfort to Tempus Spatium.

54
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:33,280
It is our duty to become powerful.

55
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:36,280
More and more powerful.

56
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,980
Powerful? For what purpose?

57
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:50,230
Neviril!
Do you hear what I'm hearing?

58
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,640
This is...

59
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:29,530
This is Neviril of Chor Tempest.
Are you all right?

60
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,540
They fell... Which Simoun fell?

61
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,580
All of them.

62
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,300
Chor Caput has fallen.

63
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:43,250
We are the only survivors.

64
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:49,220
Send a messenger
to Guragief-sama right away.

65
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:53,920
Sibylla Aurea, please be careful.

66
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,670
That's impossible.

67
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,690
A Simoun was shot down...

68
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,780
Calm down, Neviril.

69
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,490
We knew this day
would come someday.

70
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:30,230
Ever since the day they decided
to send us into battle with Simouns.

71
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,730
No, Amuria.
Simouns are divine aircraft.

72
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,670
No matter what country
develops a flying machine...

73
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,430
...they cannot match the craft of gods.

74
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:44,770
That's why enemies flee
at the sight of a Simoun...

75
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,110
They flee when they see us...

76
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,610
My lady...

77
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,710
Did I say something?

78
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:54,250
Are we going to die?

79
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,050
But I'm with you,
Para-sama, I don't mind dying.

80
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,990
I still have things to do. I can't die.

81
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,560
You mean Neviril?

82
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,230
Did I allow such familiar
addressing, Kaim?

83
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,570
Oh, we need your permission.

84
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:14,730
I wonder if they're good? Shoukoku's
flying machines float like clouds, right?

85
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,770
There must be some mistake.

86
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:20,250
There's no question.
Simouns can't fall.

87
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:23,880
We just fly them,
and the enemy runs off.

88
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:25,710
Sublime harmony...

89
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:29,280
Neviril, let's try the Emerald Ri Majon.

90
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,350
That again. We don't have the ancient
Ri Majon patterns fully analyzed yet.

91
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:38,800
Simoun sibyllae of legend succeeded
with an Emerald Ri Majon...

92
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:41,960
...and served as priestesses
close to Tempus Spatium.

93
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,230
If we succeed,
we can end up that way too.

94
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:49,300
You're so impatient. Now isn't
the time to think of such things.

95
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:52,180
I want to become more powerful.

96
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:56,880
That's the border. I'm taking us down.

97
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,040
The Simouns are divine aircraft.

98
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:28,910
True, the technology is on
a whole different level than ours.

99
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:34,980
But if we can discover their secret,
our country will make great advances.

100
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:57,180
The Falcon Ri Majon.

101
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:19,800
If they dare to enter our country,
then they'll never leave.

102
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,740
They're just flying after all.
They're not like Simouns.

103
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:33,080
A Simoun inscribes patterns upon
the sky using the light from its wake.

104
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,450
That is a Ri Majon.

105
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:39,850
We haven't yet discovered
why it's so powerful.

106
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:46,960
Once we find out this secret,
our nation's technology will advance.

107
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:53,730
But Kyuukoku has long kept
the secrets of the Simouns from us.

108
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,500
We've been taught that Simouns
send those who pursue them to hell.

109
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:03,480
But now I see.
The Simouns are mere machines.

110
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,440
There's no hell in sight.

111
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,650
How can there be so many?

112
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,950
The Simouns aren't divine aircraft.
They're just machines.

113
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:22,890
So they can fall.
It's possible to shoot them down.

114
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,090
Someday we'll solve
the Ri Majon mystery.

115
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:31,500
The era of Kyuukoku's monopoly
on Simoun technology will end.

116
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:35,630
There are a lot, but they're slowpokes!
Shoot them all down!

117
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,900
Shark Ri Majon!

118
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,150
Six-unit Iron Ri Majon...

119
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,690
Got it!

120
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,730
They'll erase the glyph!

121
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,370
What's with them?

122
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,710
If they fail to draw a glyph,
they can't achieve a Ri Majon.

123
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:29,920
The Emerald Ri Majon, Neviril.
A miracle is sure to happen.

124
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:33,730
No, Amuria.
There's no telling what will happen...

125
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:37,170
I want to become stronger.
I want to become stronger, Neviril.

126
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:41,830
I can't go on like this!
So many things getting in our way.

127
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:44,210
They're taking our wings away.

128
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,610
That's right... We've got to fight.

129
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,420
Amuria!

130
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:57,420
I said I want to become stronger.
You understand, right, Neviril?

131
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:59,120
We can do it.

132
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:19,110
Let's go. To where we can be free.

133
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,980
Neviril, more... More powerful, Neviril.

134
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,040
Yes.

135
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,400
She was so beautiful...

136
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:17,760
Neviril, don't look! You can't
kill them if you see their eyes!

137
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,540
Neviril!

138
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,480
The Emerald Ri Majon failed.

139
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,950
What's going on?

140
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:47,530
Neviril!

141
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,590
Tempus Spatium is full of fury.

142
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:54,370
The Simouns are machines.

143
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,570
Not divine aircraft at all.

144
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,740
My country will surely
discover this demonic secret...

145
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,270
But could it be...

146
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:07,580
...they really were...

147
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,100
Huh?

148
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:28,000
Sibylla Aurea is exhausted.
I'll relay your message.

149
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:30,060
Paraietta-sama.

150
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:32,560
Um, we're...

151
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,700
...leaving the ship?

152
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,500
Yes.

153
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:42,970
We intend to go to
the Spring to meet with Onasia.

154
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:45,640
If you go, you can't be a sibylla.

155
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,660
You'll never be able to touch
a Simoun again. You're sure?

156
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,290
Yes.

157
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:52,920
Yes.
I intend to become a male.

158
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:56,120
To become just as gallant as you.

159
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:59,930
It's unseemly to speak of
such intentions to others. Go on.

160
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:16,510
Do you plan to stare at
her door forever, senpai?

161
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:20,250
I am unable
to assuage a sibylla's grief.

162
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,220
All I can do is grieve just as much.

163
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,300
Are you a trainee?

164
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:43,170
This is the sanctuary
of the sibyllae. Leave.

165
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,310
Are the priestesses
in better humor now?

166
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:52,180
Should the moon be covered
by clouds, the stars fade too.

167
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:54,410
That's where they stand.

168
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,890
They have lost a precious pair.
They're not to blame.

169
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:05,700
Chor Tempest has lost three sibyllae.
Not counting those going to the Spring.

170
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,670
Meaning it is no longer our elite chor?

171
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:09,860
Dux.

172
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:12,030
What is it?

173
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,110
Sibylla Floe. Sibylla Rimone.

174
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:15,900
Actually, this child...

175
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:17,840
Sibylla? But...

176
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:22,780
She's young, but we're having her join
Chor Tempest as a special case.

177
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:31,690
This is most irregular. Promoting
such a young trainee to sibylla.

178
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:36,490
But if we don't, we'll no longer
be able to protect the Simouns.

179
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,790
So is that doll your only replacement?

180
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:42,860
No, there's one more before launch.

181
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,340
Another oddball?

182
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,770
Another oddball?
No, a normal one, Captain.

183
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,250
Who's that?

184
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:05,390
Wow! This is a Simoun, huh?

185
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:07,860
I've never seen the real thing before.

186
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,760
Sibylla Aer?
I expected you to arrive sooner.

187
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:23,900
Shoukoku's planes are advancing
along the border once again.

188
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:26,040
I'm sending Chor Tempest.

189
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:28,380
Isn't that futile?

190
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,140
I'm sure Neviril won't like it.

191
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,620
I agree.

192
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,320
I don't see Neviril and Paraietta here.

193
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,220
They won't want to fly.

194
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:41,950
I'm so scared...

195
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:45,520
We have nothing but
the Simouns to fight with.

196
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:49,760
But is it God's will that
we do something like this?

197
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,360
I'm going up.

198
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:54,030
I'm on my way.

199
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,370
Please wait, Sibylla Aer!

200
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,980
She's probably not a priestess.

201
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,660
That's a Simile training craft!

202
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:23,000
That can't achieve a Ri Majon...

203
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:36,080
The rest of you can go on praying.

204
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:39,810
I've come here to go into battle.

205
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:53,930
It is played by my wounds...
the song of prayer.

206
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:58,160
Let it ring out over
the grieving universe.

207
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:05,200
Can we change tomorrow?
Don't be afraid.

208
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:13,150
I want to let you know
how my heart's overflowing.

209
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,690
"I want to get closer to you."
"I want to feel your pulse."

210
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:30,900
I was too defiant,
and I took the long way around.

211
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,870
The blue moon is swaying silently.

212
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:38,780
My true heart's desire is you.

213
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:44,540
I can't reach you.
My tears of pain trickle down.

214
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:50,320
Soar away into the sky, song of prayer.

215
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:53,720
Carrying my love that came too late.

216
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:59,390
What can I do to change tomorrow?

217
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:05,870
Just hold on to "now" the way it is...

218
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,600
To Be Continued

219
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:18,450
Simouns can't
possibly fall, and yet they have.

220
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,620
The Blue Spring
Next time on Simoun...

221
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:26,020
The Blue Spring
The Blue Spring.
