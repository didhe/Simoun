00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:05,931
<i>Let's Explicitly Expose the "Simoun"</i>
<i>Cast's True Natures on This Program</i>

2
00:00:06,306 --> 00:00:10,208
<i>The Guests for the Milestone</i>
<i>First Episode are These Two</i>

3
00:00:10,543 --> 00:00:11,601
Monthly!

4
00:00:12,245 --> 00:00:13,542
ADR!

5
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:19,985
Bulletin!

6
00:00:23,823 --> 00:00:27,623
Nice to meet you. My name
is Michi Niino, and I play Aer.

7
00:00:27,727 --> 00:00:31,823
Hello! I'm Rieko Takahashi,
and I play Neviril.

8
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:36,825
All right, so anyway...
The ADR Bulletin has started.

9
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:40,830
Let's do a laid-back show, shall we?

10
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,170
The two of us...

11
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:47,042
...are going to be ourselves
during this time with you.

12
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:51,940
<i>And I'm your MC.</i>
<i>Just call me Simoun.</i>

13
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:57,223
No-Holds-Barred!?

14
00:00:57,223 --> 00:01:02,126
No-Holds-Barred!?
Brutal, Live Talk Show.

15
00:01:03,763 --> 00:01:04,730
Right.

16
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:08,528
This is a live session.

17
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,266
Now what are these?

18
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:16,570
Well, we're going to turn over
these cards one by one, you see.

19
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:19,304
Something written on the back then.

20
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:23,508
So whatever turns up,
let's give a laid-back answer.

21
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:26,017
So here's the first card...

22
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:28,383
May I pick the first one?

23
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:31,218
Okay, I'll start with this one.

24
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:32,583
Ta-da.

25
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:40,798
Ah, this is what I picked. Were you
uncomfortable doing explicit scenes?

26
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,299
Starting with me?

27
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:43,835
You turned it over.

28
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,531
I'll start this, huh? Well, I...

29
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:50,837
Um, I didn't really
have any explicit scenes.

30
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:55,347
I did have some
kissing scenes... We all did...

31
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,609
All the sibyllae kissed, right?

32
00:01:57,717 --> 00:02:02,086
But in my case,
my scenes were all normal.

33
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:05,817
Oh, it's not that
my private life is totally normal...

34
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,957
No, that's not what I meant. Sorry.

35
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:12,890
They weren't especially...

36
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:17,225
<i>Aer, your face is red</i>

37
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,739
So now it's my turn?

38
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,207
Right. I'll take this one.

39
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:28,041
Have you ever fallen
in love with a woman?

40
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,581
Well, well!

41
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:34,242
Well, I went to
an all-girls' school, you see.

42
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:35,514
Oh, really?

43
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:42,960
And there was an older
student who was a little boyish...

44
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:47,726
There was a time when
my heart fluttered over that older girl.

45
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,325
This happened a long time ago...

46
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:52,336
All right, shall we move on?

47
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:53,928
Let's move on!

48
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,441
Let's see... Okay, this one.

49
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:58,909
Here we go.

50
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,704
I felt I'd get this one!

51
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:05,147
If you had to think of
a name for your pair?

52
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:06,445
Okay.

53
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:12,982
We fly the same Simoun, you see...

54
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:16,060
...and if we were to name it...

55
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:18,758
Our pair's name?

56
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,730
What do you think?

57
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:27,329
You know the Ri M_a_jon
Neviril did today to return...

58
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,271
The Diamond Ri M_a_jon?

59
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,866
Diamond?

60
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:34,105
Is something funny about that?

61
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:39,550
It's a diamond! That's
an outrageous name for a pair!

62
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:45,386
It makes you think, "What kind
of pattern are they going to draw?"

63
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:50,087
Well, personally,
I'd like to go with "diamond"...

64
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,663
You're really sure?

65
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:56,167
<i>Who cares if you're sure.</i>
<i>Just hurry up and make a decision!</i>

66
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,895
<i>Let's move on to the next corner!</i>

67
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:01,841
Why Oh Why!?

68
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:03,638
Why Oh Why!?
Simoun.

69
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,039
All right then...

70
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:13,114
Is this a quiz?
Since it's called "Why Oh Why?"

71
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:15,585
We'll be asked some questions...

72
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:19,522
...and they'll test how much
we've done our homework.

73
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:21,992
Let's do our best.

74
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:23,162
Well...

75
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:27,893
<i>What does pair mean?</i>

76
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:30,661
T-Team?

77
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,796
To ride together?

78
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:37,899
To... ride... together...

79
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,840
Teammate?

80
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,314
That's not it. Team...

81
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:48,211
It's something...

82
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,388
Pa... Pa...

83
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:54,460
Partner!

84
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,427
<i>Correct... Try to get</i>
<i>some laughs, will you?</i>

85
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:01,564
Where'd that come from?
You just heard a voice, didn't you?

86
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:04,466
I heard the voice of God just now.

87
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:10,167
It's your partner when you fly
a Simoun... That's your pair.

88
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:15,174
<i>Now why don't you</i>
<i>talk about the CDs?</i>

89
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:21,351
We'd like to tell you about Simoun's
opening and ending themes.

90
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:23,251
This is the opening...

91
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:27,821
...sung by Chiaki Ishikawa,
"Utsukushikereba soredeii."
("All You Have to Be Is Beautiful")

92
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:30,953
It's said it was
written with Neviril in mind.

93
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:34,795
It's a very beautiful song,
and it's selling to wide acclaim.

94
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:37,699
Right, and this is the ending theme...

95
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:44,607
...performed by Savage Genius.
It's called "Inori no uta."
("The Song of Prayer")

96
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:48,044
It's the kind of song
that touches your heart...

97
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:51,048
So I hope you give it a listen!

98
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:57,983
<i>It's just about time to say goodbye...</i>
<i>Make sure you close out the show!</i>

99
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:03,892
Good job, everyone!

100
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:07,022
I guess we were
laid-back to the very end.

101
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,966
It's almost time for
us to say goodbye...

102
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:12,799
Aer-chan, what did
you think of today's show?

103
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:15,999
I learned a lot today.

104
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:21,103
Things I'd never known till now...
Or rather things I should've but didn't.

105
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:24,843
It cleared up a lot of mysteries,
so it was a good experience.

106
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:27,419
What did you think, Neviril-san?

107
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:32,517
Let's see... I think I'll make
sure I study up from now on.

108
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,922
All right.

109
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:39,657
I hope you continue to watch Simoun.

110
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:40,366
<i>Don't miss the next show!!</i>

111
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:41,901
<i>Don't miss the next show!!</i>
Fade out...

112
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,766
<i>Don't miss the next show!!</i>

113
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:50,606
<i>The way they're going,</i>
<i>I wonder if there'll be another show...</i>
