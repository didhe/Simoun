1
00:00:00,624 --> 00:00:09,624
The countless flowers,
enveloped in light...

2
00:00:09,734 --> 00:00:20,234
...gaze at tomorrow
with unwavering eyes.

3
00:00:32,224 --> 00:00:38,884
Everyone wishes for me to be pure...

4
00:00:39,494 --> 00:00:46,594
...but what can I bring
with me to the frayed skies?

5
00:00:46,704 --> 00:00:53,764
What I've made my own
by breaking off flowers in bloom...

6
00:00:54,074 --> 00:00:59,344
All such sinful things...

7
00:00:59,444 --> 00:01:06,824
Why did I stop making
promises with the future?

8
00:01:06,924 --> 00:01:14,094
Because even if I try
to run far from all the pain...

9
00:01:14,194 --> 00:01:20,834
...a cold wind rustles
my hair... Don't you see?

10
00:01:20,934 --> 00:01:28,344
Where can I ever find the answer?

11
00:01:53,634 --> 00:01:59,594
The Door to a New World

12
00:02:22,664 --> 00:02:24,894
I've never seen
such insubordination!

13
00:02:24,964 --> 00:02:28,564
This is why I was against
disbanding Rubor and Caput!

14
00:02:32,204 --> 00:02:34,834
We cannot afford to rely
solely on Chor Tempest!

15
00:02:34,914 --> 00:02:36,404
Gather all our troops and Similes!

16
00:02:36,484 --> 00:02:39,004
The patrol Similes and the
cruise Similes. I want them all!

17
00:02:39,084 --> 00:02:40,014
Yes, sir!

18
00:02:41,884 --> 00:02:42,814
What a fool.

19
00:02:44,724 --> 00:02:47,054
Conflict will not
bring about a solution.

20
00:03:02,804 --> 00:03:04,204
Onasia...

21
00:03:24,324 --> 00:03:27,554
I told you not to do that!
Stop playing with the Simoun!

22
00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:30,194
Huh? So how come?

23
00:03:30,264 --> 00:03:31,524
How come?

24
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:33,794
Well, because...

25
00:03:35,604 --> 00:03:36,694
Let's see...

26
00:03:40,344 --> 00:03:41,464
What's that?

27
00:03:41,544 --> 00:03:44,944
It's making a sound,
like it's humming!

28
00:03:45,284 --> 00:03:46,214
No way!

29
00:03:48,284 --> 00:03:50,914
Hey, you're right!
It's humming.

30
00:03:50,984 --> 00:03:52,644
It sounds like a whistle!

31
00:03:52,724 --> 00:03:54,214
You too, Rimone!

32
00:04:04,834 --> 00:04:05,694
Well? Well?

33
00:04:07,174 --> 00:04:09,434
I can hear a humming sound.

34
00:04:10,744 --> 00:04:11,704
Right? Right?

35
00:04:44,644 --> 00:04:45,604
I see...

36
00:04:46,274 --> 00:04:48,604
So that day has finally come.

37
00:04:50,214 --> 00:04:52,404
Please give us a little time.

38
00:04:54,254 --> 00:04:57,184
Would you mind waiting
until we've finished eating?

39
00:05:02,954 --> 00:05:05,894
Have negotiations
broken down then?

40
00:05:06,294 --> 00:05:09,784
Onasia is the symbol
of Simulacrum Kyuukoku.

41
00:05:10,034 --> 00:05:12,434
Undoubtedly it is to our
superiors' advantage that she...

42
00:05:12,504 --> 00:05:14,434
...maintain her current silence.

43
00:05:15,034 --> 00:05:18,834
Nevertheless, should Onasia
decide to make a move...

44
00:05:19,544 --> 00:05:21,904
I certainly don't enjoy conflict.

45
00:05:21,974 --> 00:05:23,074
Even so...

46
00:05:23,144 --> 00:05:26,344
Bringing Onasia here
at a time like this...

47
00:05:27,014 --> 00:05:30,004
I just don't understand what the
high priestess could be thinking.

48
00:05:30,084 --> 00:05:31,314
Guragief...

49
00:05:31,584 --> 00:05:32,754
Suppose I...

50
00:05:32,754 --> 00:05:33,724
Suppose I...
What?

51
00:05:35,554 --> 00:05:36,684
Never mind...

52
00:05:55,414 --> 00:05:59,144
Taking off in the Simouns
without authorization...

53
00:05:59,214 --> 00:06:01,474
...is an unprecedented infraction!

54
00:06:01,954 --> 00:06:04,074
Where is your sense
of responsibility?

55
00:06:04,484 --> 00:06:05,614
Responsibility?

56
00:06:05,724 --> 00:06:08,814
Do we recognize that we're Simoun
sibyllae and take pride in that?

57
00:06:08,894 --> 00:06:12,354
Yes, I would say that's true
of each and every one of us!

58
00:06:16,804 --> 00:06:18,764
Is that all you have to say to us?

59
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,334
If so, please excuse us.

60
00:06:28,774 --> 00:06:31,114
You little brats!

61
00:06:40,994 --> 00:06:41,854
Paraietta...

62
00:06:44,594 --> 00:06:45,854
Vura...

63
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:49,354
And Roatreamon and Alty, too!

64
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,364
Just as we thought, Paraietta...

65
00:06:52,664 --> 00:06:54,194
You couldn't sleep either, huh?

66
00:06:54,474 --> 00:06:56,094
Neither could we.

67
00:06:59,304 --> 00:07:00,464
Para-sama...

68
00:07:04,684 --> 00:07:07,584
Hey, is the whole gang here then?

69
00:07:38,614 --> 00:07:41,554
We shall send Onasia
back on the Messis.

70
00:07:41,754 --> 00:07:44,044
Sibylla Neviril, Sibylla Aer...

71
00:07:46,354 --> 00:07:48,014
May I ask you to join us?

72
00:07:50,524 --> 00:07:54,254
Do you not want to know more
about that different world?

73
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,494
Me too...

74
00:07:58,804 --> 00:08:00,394
Will you take me too?

75
00:08:00,834 --> 00:08:01,494
Um...

76
00:08:01,804 --> 00:08:04,534
No, we cannot go in
such great numbers.

77
00:08:05,574 --> 00:08:07,044
Please.

78
00:08:26,194 --> 00:08:27,224
Is it good?

79
00:08:28,194 --> 00:08:29,594
Um...

80
00:08:30,664 --> 00:08:31,894
I'm not sure...

81
00:08:32,404 --> 00:08:33,804
...I'd call it good.

82
00:08:34,804 --> 00:08:37,934
It's a little bitter, I think.

83
00:08:38,274 --> 00:08:41,034
And it's also a little bit sweet.

84
00:08:42,874 --> 00:08:44,904
But it's not that
I don't like it.

85
00:08:45,144 --> 00:08:46,174
I think...

86
00:08:46,244 --> 00:08:48,274
...I can finish it all.

87
00:08:51,154 --> 00:08:52,414
"I don't know..."

88
00:08:52,484 --> 00:08:53,314
What?

89
00:08:53,694 --> 00:08:56,524
You've stopped saying
that all the time, Rimone.

90
00:08:57,064 --> 00:08:58,394
Yes...

91
00:08:58,464 --> 00:08:59,954
I'm starting to realize...

92
00:09:00,024 --> 00:09:03,054
...that if you really think about it,
there's nothing you can't understand.

93
00:09:03,134 --> 00:09:04,094
That's why...

94
00:09:04,864 --> 00:09:06,464
I'm the opposite.

95
00:09:08,834 --> 00:09:11,804
The more I think about
something, the more lost I get.

96
00:09:13,404 --> 00:09:15,134
Dominüra...

97
00:09:19,114 --> 00:09:22,104
All right, let's finish eating,
and then we're going.

98
00:09:22,514 --> 00:09:23,484
Where?

99
00:09:27,724 --> 00:09:29,154
I don't know.

100
00:09:32,464 --> 00:09:34,984
The high priestess
has ordered us...

101
00:09:35,064 --> 00:09:37,294
...to make this as smooth
a flight as possible.

102
00:09:37,364 --> 00:09:38,164
Right.

103
00:09:39,464 --> 00:09:41,694
I wonder where we're headed.

104
00:09:54,154 --> 00:09:55,114
What do you want?

105
00:09:55,654 --> 00:09:56,614
Um...

106
00:09:57,524 --> 00:10:00,484
Onasia-sama is at rest now.

107
00:10:00,554 --> 00:10:01,784
Let her in.

108
00:10:19,144 --> 00:10:20,104
Onasia?

109
00:10:21,744 --> 00:10:25,004
Why did she bring up
the "different world"?

110
00:10:25,084 --> 00:10:28,054
That high priestess...
There's something about her.

111
00:10:29,054 --> 00:10:31,414
Sure, the military councilor's
an annoying old man too...

112
00:10:31,484 --> 00:10:32,884
...but that high priestess...

113
00:10:33,124 --> 00:10:34,554
...I don't know...

114
00:10:38,594 --> 00:10:39,284
What?

115
00:10:40,734 --> 00:10:41,994
Your hands...

116
00:10:42,064 --> 00:10:43,294
...they're so small.

117
00:10:47,204 --> 00:10:48,964
Don't treat me like a kid!

118
00:10:49,704 --> 00:10:52,904
War makes things that
should be obvious...

119
00:10:53,174 --> 00:10:55,144
...so very hard
to see, doesn't it?

120
00:11:02,484 --> 00:11:03,574
Onasia...

121
00:11:05,354 --> 00:11:07,844
There is something
you wish to ask me.

122
00:11:09,324 --> 00:11:12,624
You told me that you
could hear Mamina's voice.

123
00:11:12,694 --> 00:11:14,994
So... what about my comrades?

124
00:11:17,704 --> 00:11:20,604
Have their souls been released?

125
00:11:25,244 --> 00:11:27,404
The one who really
wishes to be released...

126
00:11:28,074 --> 00:11:29,104
...is you yourself.

127
00:11:31,284 --> 00:11:36,474
By placing yourself at the
brink of your comrades' deaths...

128
00:11:36,554 --> 00:11:40,614
...you are actually trying to flee
as far as possible from those deaths.

129
00:11:53,434 --> 00:11:54,634
Onasia-sama...

130
00:11:54,974 --> 00:11:56,434
We seem to have arrived.

131
00:12:42,754 --> 00:12:44,614
Why the Ruins?

132
00:12:53,194 --> 00:12:54,394
There it goes again.

133
00:12:55,034 --> 00:12:57,024
The door to a new world!

134
00:12:57,464 --> 00:13:00,164
The melody played
by that music box...

135
00:13:00,234 --> 00:13:05,974
...as well as the unintended destination
of those who lost their lives here.

136
00:13:06,144 --> 00:13:06,664
What?

137
00:13:07,044 --> 00:13:08,344
That's right...

138
00:13:08,414 --> 00:13:10,904
This was once the training
ground for Chor Dextra.

139
00:13:11,614 --> 00:13:13,634
Chor Dextra?

140
00:13:13,984 --> 00:13:15,574
Sibylla Aer...

141
00:13:15,654 --> 00:13:18,644
...that was the chor your own
grandfather served as regina for.

142
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:21,154
Grandpa... a regina?

143
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:37,894
Can I ask you something?

144
00:13:38,104 --> 00:13:38,864
Yes.

145
00:13:39,244 --> 00:13:40,764
That day...

146
00:13:40,844 --> 00:13:42,314
What happened that day?

147
00:13:42,944 --> 00:13:44,344
What day?

148
00:13:44,414 --> 00:13:45,884
On the Messis...

149
00:13:48,584 --> 00:13:50,274
It all came surging back...

150
00:13:50,624 --> 00:13:51,604
What?

151
00:13:52,124 --> 00:13:54,954
The moment I looked into
the helical motors...

152
00:13:55,024 --> 00:13:56,544
It was as if I was seeing...

153
00:13:56,724 --> 00:13:57,694
Somebody's...

154
00:13:57,994 --> 00:13:59,624
The memory of something...

155
00:14:01,994 --> 00:14:04,994
What you see there is
nothing but a helix.

156
00:14:05,164 --> 00:14:08,334
As it turns out, the only thing
we're capable of understanding is...

157
00:14:10,504 --> 00:14:12,034
Sibylla Dominüra?

158
00:14:28,624 --> 00:14:29,784
Dominüra...

159
00:14:36,134 --> 00:14:40,294
And then we became enthralled
with Ri Majons... and the Simouns.

160
00:14:40,704 --> 00:14:44,934
But that was because we had nothing
but the Simouns to cling to...

161
00:14:45,004 --> 00:14:45,974
That's right...

162
00:14:46,044 --> 00:14:48,974
If the Simouns had never
existed in the first place...

163
00:14:49,614 --> 00:14:51,874
Or even if they had existed...

164
00:14:51,944 --> 00:14:54,714
...but no one ever
discovered how to use them...

165
00:14:54,814 --> 00:14:56,254
...then what would have happened?

166
00:14:56,414 --> 00:14:58,544
Huh? Well...

167
00:14:59,084 --> 00:15:00,524
Um...

168
00:15:00,824 --> 00:15:02,014
I think...

169
00:15:03,524 --> 00:15:04,784
I think...

170
00:15:17,544 --> 00:15:18,934
We brought them here!

171
00:15:19,004 --> 00:15:20,334
We brought them here!

172
00:15:20,644 --> 00:15:21,904
They're here!

173
00:15:38,224 --> 00:15:42,754
Long, long ago, there was a
civilization far superior to ours.

174
00:15:42,834 --> 00:15:47,234
And it is said that the Simouns
were in existence at that time.

175
00:15:48,004 --> 00:15:50,994
But after a succession
of wars broke out...

176
00:15:51,074 --> 00:15:53,094
...the country was left in ruins.

177
00:15:53,974 --> 00:15:56,064
And once all of the lands
were rendered worthless...

178
00:15:56,144 --> 00:15:58,674
...there was no longer
any reason to wage war.

179
00:15:59,344 --> 00:16:01,944
The starving multitudes no
longer needed the Simouns...

180
00:16:02,014 --> 00:16:03,814
...and eventually they
forgot how to use them.

181
00:16:05,124 --> 00:16:06,414
The people...

182
00:16:06,484 --> 00:16:09,824
...had no choice but to wait for
certain destruction at nature's hands.

183
00:16:16,334 --> 00:16:18,324
It was then that something
broke through the sky...

184
00:16:18,404 --> 00:16:21,194
...and a Simoun arrived
from a different world.

185
00:16:22,374 --> 00:16:25,674
On board that Simoun
were two children of God.

186
00:16:26,204 --> 00:16:27,174
These young girls...

187
00:16:29,044 --> 00:16:33,314
These young girls announced
themselves as "Simoun sibyllae."

188
00:16:33,384 --> 00:16:34,174
And...

189
00:16:34,784 --> 00:16:36,914
They then shared the secret
of the Emerald Ri Majon!

190
00:16:37,184 --> 00:16:38,914
The Emerald Ri Majon?

191
00:16:39,324 --> 00:16:40,314
That's right.

192
00:16:40,384 --> 00:16:41,784
To a different world...

193
00:16:41,854 --> 00:16:46,414
No, that which transports one to a
different time, the ultimate Ri Majon!

194
00:16:47,064 --> 00:16:50,934
It is a divine gift.
A magnificent "if."

195
00:16:53,704 --> 00:16:55,694
What if during that era...

196
00:16:55,774 --> 00:16:58,674
...they had told the people
that another war was coming?

197
00:16:59,204 --> 00:17:02,264
If the Simouns hadn't existed...

198
00:17:02,674 --> 00:17:05,164
...then I might never
have existed either.

199
00:17:05,784 --> 00:17:07,514
If, during that era...

200
00:17:07,584 --> 00:17:10,744
...they found a way to convince the
people of the need for Simouns...

201
00:17:15,254 --> 00:17:18,054
But if I'd never existed...

202
00:17:18,124 --> 00:17:20,964
...then this pain never
would've existed either.

203
00:17:21,434 --> 00:17:24,924
This era so full of hardship
and strife might be changed.

204
00:17:25,764 --> 00:17:27,494
To transcend time and space...

205
00:17:27,574 --> 00:17:30,694
...and offer this
"if" to some other era.

206
00:17:31,104 --> 00:17:33,004
That is precisely the purpose...

207
00:17:33,074 --> 00:17:36,444
...of the Simouns and
of the Emerald Ri Majon.

208
00:17:36,814 --> 00:17:38,404
Transcend time and space?

209
00:17:38,484 --> 00:17:40,774
Unbelievable... How could that...

210
00:17:40,854 --> 00:17:44,714
Wait a minute! Then what about this
Chor Dextra you say my grandpa led?

211
00:17:44,884 --> 00:17:46,474
Chor Dextra...

212
00:17:46,554 --> 00:17:50,584
...was created for the sole purpose
of completing the Emerald Ri Majon.

213
00:17:50,964 --> 00:17:54,984
Someone you know very well was
also a former member of this chor.

214
00:17:55,094 --> 00:17:55,994
Huh?

215
00:17:56,634 --> 00:17:58,194
Sibylla Dominüra...

216
00:17:58,264 --> 00:18:02,134
She is the last surviving
member of Chor Dextra.

217
00:18:06,474 --> 00:18:07,704
Dominüra?

218
00:18:08,844 --> 00:18:09,814
That's right.

219
00:18:10,244 --> 00:18:12,214
I had the misfortune to find out...

220
00:18:21,354 --> 00:18:22,114
That everything...

221
00:18:22,794 --> 00:18:25,854
That everything that
happened started with me.

222
00:18:44,114 --> 00:18:45,084
Just now...

223
00:18:45,284 --> 00:18:46,074
What?

224
00:18:46,144 --> 00:18:49,674
I thought about what
you just said, Dominüra.

225
00:18:50,384 --> 00:18:52,584
You know, if the Simouns
had never existed...

226
00:18:54,154 --> 00:18:55,414
If they hadn't?

227
00:18:56,024 --> 00:18:56,994
Yes.

228
00:18:57,154 --> 00:19:00,594
Then I never would've met
everyone in Chor Tempest.

229
00:19:01,034 --> 00:19:02,554
And, Dominüra...

230
00:19:03,534 --> 00:19:05,434
...I never would've met you.

231
00:19:11,704 --> 00:19:13,534
Why are you crying?

232
00:19:14,944 --> 00:19:16,344
I wonder why?

233
00:19:16,744 --> 00:19:17,604
Well...

234
00:19:17,684 --> 00:19:18,874
Um...

235
00:19:18,984 --> 00:19:20,444
Because you're sad?

236
00:19:20,514 --> 00:19:21,944
Because you're lonely?

237
00:19:22,284 --> 00:19:23,804
Because it hurts?

238
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:25,214
What else...

239
00:19:25,324 --> 00:19:26,514
Let's see...

240
00:19:28,524 --> 00:19:30,354
Because you're happy?

241
00:19:31,494 --> 00:19:32,624
That's right.

242
00:19:33,224 --> 00:19:34,354
Because I'm happy.

243
00:19:38,664 --> 00:19:39,634
Let's go.

244
00:19:40,604 --> 00:19:43,094
You mean go without
knowing where again?

245
00:19:43,604 --> 00:19:44,574
No.

246
00:19:44,974 --> 00:19:45,994
I do know where.

247
00:20:07,264 --> 00:20:12,094
Under the blue sky.

248
00:20:12,864 --> 00:20:17,804
Beyond the white clouds.

249
00:20:18,544 --> 00:20:23,274
It's as blue as a tear.

250
00:20:23,344 --> 00:20:28,684
As white as a lily.

251
00:20:29,914 --> 00:20:34,514
In the pitch-black darkness.

252
00:20:35,624 --> 00:20:40,184
The light of a red flame.

253
00:20:44,234 --> 00:20:49,174
Sibylla Dominüra most likely
completed the Emerald Ri Majon.

254
00:20:49,374 --> 00:20:50,564
Then you mean...

255
00:20:51,074 --> 00:20:52,904
She is alive in another time.

256
00:20:55,344 --> 00:20:59,144
Sibylla Dominüra and Sibylla
Rimone are both alive.

257
00:20:59,614 --> 00:21:01,744
I am certain that they are.

258
00:21:01,854 --> 00:21:02,614
Then...

259
00:21:04,484 --> 00:21:05,474
Amuria...

260
00:21:06,624 --> 00:21:07,854
Then...

261
00:21:08,224 --> 00:21:11,484
...does that mean that Amuria
may also be alive somewhere?

262
00:21:14,694 --> 00:21:19,134
The Emerald Ri Majon was a
divine gift. Our only hope...

263
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:23,064
Whether it will take us into the
future or back into the past...

264
00:21:23,374 --> 00:21:25,064
That is not for us to know.

265
00:21:26,244 --> 00:21:27,334
However...

266
00:21:27,404 --> 00:21:31,314
...it is by the will of the gods of
Tempus Spatium that the Simouns exist.

267
00:21:32,044 --> 00:21:33,444
Therefore...

268
00:21:33,514 --> 00:21:35,814
...the gods cannot be mistaken.

269
00:21:36,954 --> 00:21:41,544
I am positive that they will
open the door to the correct era.

270
00:21:41,994 --> 00:21:43,394
Sibylla Neviril...

271
00:21:43,694 --> 00:21:44,854
Sibylla Aer...

272
00:21:45,764 --> 00:21:47,124
I would like to...

273
00:21:47,194 --> 00:21:49,094
...entrust this task to you.

274
00:21:50,334 --> 00:21:52,564
The Emerald Ri Majon!

275
00:22:02,014 --> 00:22:02,844
Get a move on!

276
00:22:05,914 --> 00:22:08,244
You say it's a Simoun
from the Arcus Niger?

277
00:22:08,554 --> 00:22:09,534
Military councilor!

278
00:22:09,614 --> 00:22:11,844
What's the meaning of this?

279
00:22:12,824 --> 00:22:14,224
The Arcus Niger...

280
00:22:15,354 --> 00:22:16,584
...was shot down.

281
00:22:17,394 --> 00:22:18,364
Wha?

282
00:22:19,694 --> 00:22:22,424
Seven o'clock! Five ancient
Simouns approaching fast!

283
00:22:22,494 --> 00:22:23,324
What in the world?

284
00:22:41,154 --> 00:22:47,784
It is played by my wounds...
the song of prayer.

285
00:22:47,894 --> 00:22:52,024
Let it ring out over
the grieving universe.

286
00:22:52,124 --> 00:22:59,094
Can we change tomorrow?
Don't be afraid.

287
00:22:59,204 --> 00:23:06,764
I want to let you know
how my heart's overflowing.

288
00:23:15,584 --> 00:23:19,574
I want to get closer to you.
I want to feel your pulse.

289
00:23:19,684 --> 00:23:24,754
I was too defiant,
and I took the long way around.

290
00:23:24,864 --> 00:23:28,724
The blue moon is swaying silently.

291
00:23:28,834 --> 00:23:32,764
My true heart's desire is you.

292
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:38,634
I can't reach you.
My tears of pain trickle down.

293
00:23:38,744 --> 00:23:44,174
Soar away into the
sky, song of prayer.

294
00:23:44,274 --> 00:23:47,614
Carrying my love that came too late.

295
00:23:47,714 --> 00:23:53,274
What can I do to change tomorrow?

296
00:23:53,384 --> 00:23:59,584
Just hold on to "now" the way it is...

297
00:24:04,904 --> 00:24:06,034
To Be Continued

298
00:24:06,034 --> 00:24:06,564
To Be Continued
The Shoukoku-Plumbum highlands allied forces...

299
00:24:06,564 --> 00:24:08,504
The Shoukoku-Plumbum highlands allied forces...

300
00:24:08,574 --> 00:24:10,404
...have begun their
invasion of Kyuukoku...

301
00:24:10,474 --> 00:24:12,664
...and the attacks are
increasing by the day.

302
00:24:14,074 --> 00:24:15,374
Next time on Simoun...

303
00:24:15,444 --> 00:24:16,144
Sortie

304
00:24:16,144 --> 00:24:17,674
Sortie
Sortie.

305
00:24:17,674 --> 00:24:19,874
Sortie
