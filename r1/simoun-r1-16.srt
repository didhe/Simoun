1
00:00:00,949 --> 00:00:09,689
The countless flowers,
enveloped in light...

2
00:00:09,999 --> 00:00:20,369
...gaze at tomorrow
with unwavering eyes.

3
00:00:32,519 --> 00:00:39,479
Everyone wishes for me to be pure...

4
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:46,889
...but what can I bring
with me to the frayed skies?

5
00:00:46,999 --> 00:00:54,069
What I've made my own
by breaking off flowers in bloom...

6
00:00:54,339 --> 00:00:59,679
All such sinful things...

7
00:00:59,779 --> 00:01:07,119
Why did I stop making
promises with the future?

8
00:01:07,219 --> 00:01:14,419
Because even if I try
to run far from all the pain...

9
00:01:14,529 --> 00:01:20,959
...a cold wind rustles
my hair... Don't you see?

10
00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:28,569
Where can I ever find the answer?

11
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:38,479
I am Wauf, the captain of the Messis.

12
00:01:39,649 --> 00:01:45,089
The highland aerial base, found on
a Chor Tempest scouting flight...

13
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:47,489
...has since vanished without a trace.

14
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:52,889
Four of Chor Tempest's Simouns
have already left the ship.

15
00:01:52,999 --> 00:01:57,159
The sharp surge in enemy attacks
the last 12 hours is worrisome.

16
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,669
The Messis has been left with
only two Simouns on board.

17
00:02:03,609 --> 00:02:05,409
I'm getting a bad feeling...

18
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:06,669
Captain!

19
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:08,909
Everyone's in position.

20
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:11,919
The kitchen staff
can be relieved for now.

21
00:02:12,019 --> 00:02:13,209
Yes, sir!

22
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:34,859
The Emerald Ri Majon

23
00:02:47,189 --> 00:02:49,949
I'm going to do it for you.

24
00:02:50,619 --> 00:02:52,589
The Emerald Ri Majon.

25
00:02:53,929 --> 00:02:56,619
He sure does have
a screwed-up face.

26
00:02:56,729 --> 00:02:59,289
You think he takes after his owner?

27
00:02:59,399 --> 00:03:01,369
Roatreamon?

28
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:04,829
Or maybe the one who made him.

29
00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:12,009
How can you laugh?

30
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:13,839
We're in trouble!

31
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:21,349
A-Aircraft sighted!

32
00:03:21,449 --> 00:03:23,289
Um... Um...

33
00:03:23,389 --> 00:03:25,249
Nine o'clock! A fleet of planes!

34
00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:26,819
Non-Simoun!

35
00:03:27,429 --> 00:03:30,229
Nine o'clock!
A fleet of planes! Non-Simoun!

36
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:32,659
We should assume
they've spotted us.

37
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:35,059
Six o'clock! A fleet of planes!

38
00:03:35,169 --> 00:03:36,899
Take us down lower!

39
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:39,059
Any lower and we'll hit trees.

40
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:42,939
It doesn't matter! Mow them down!
Find a hiding place for this ship!

41
00:03:49,449 --> 00:03:51,309
There's a hill at one o'clock.

42
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:54,409
Turn us around at full speed!
Prepare to land!

43
00:03:58,059 --> 00:04:02,259
We can fight with two Simouns,
but it's over if the Messis falls!

44
00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:06,299
Baby birds who've lost their mother
are doomed to starve to death.

45
00:04:06,399 --> 00:04:09,659
Don't say things like that.
You'll frighten the child.

46
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:12,169
I'm not...

47
00:04:12,409 --> 00:04:15,069
Rimone's not scared at all, see?

48
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:27,349
Come on. Let's go too.

49
00:04:31,789 --> 00:04:33,549
Sibylla Dominüra...

50
00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:41,529
The Simouns are the vehicles
of the gods... They can't fall.

51
00:04:56,679 --> 00:04:59,379
What should we do, Dominüra?
Pursue the enemy?

52
00:04:59,489 --> 00:05:00,449
No.

53
00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:04,019
The priority now is
to protect the Messis.

54
00:05:04,119 --> 00:05:07,319
We'll flank and keep
its launch position undetected.

55
00:05:07,429 --> 00:05:11,329
Good idea. We'll attack by land,
using it as a smokescreen.

56
00:05:11,429 --> 00:05:12,729
Roger.

57
00:05:13,469 --> 00:05:15,199
You know what, Aer?

58
00:05:15,299 --> 00:05:16,389
Rimone?

59
00:05:16,499 --> 00:05:20,339
I kind of brought Roatreamon's
stuffed animal with me.

60
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:54,539
Drop anchor!

61
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,109
Now dropping anchor!

62
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:57,729
Captain, I believe we're
going to get away with this.

63
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:59,459
Looks like it.

64
00:07:00,409 --> 00:07:03,739
So we pulled the wool
over their eyes after all, eh?

65
00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:10,069
It seems they're gone. Aer...

66
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:11,449
Not yet.

67
00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:22,959
They made it look like they'd gone,
but they were keeping an eye out.

68
00:07:23,059 --> 00:07:25,359
Should we head back now?

69
00:07:25,999 --> 00:07:27,059
Hey...

70
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:31,799
I have no idea how to survive here.

71
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:37,239
Having honed our war skills
isn't anything to brag about.

72
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:40,539
War skills, did you say?

73
00:07:41,209 --> 00:07:43,809
That's right. It's my war skills...

74
00:07:45,689 --> 00:07:50,089
Techniques for survival...
I've got to learn more about them.

75
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:04,859
It's quiet here, isn't it?

76
00:08:09,409 --> 00:08:10,879
Dominüra?

77
00:08:12,009 --> 00:08:14,979
You said you'd do it for me, right?

78
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,209
The Emerald Ri Majon...

79
00:08:21,049 --> 00:08:24,609
I never intended to put
such a burden on you.

80
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:29,259
It's just that unless I know
I'm doing it for someone...

81
00:08:29,359 --> 00:08:33,729
...the way I am right now,
I have no chance of moving forward.

82
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:48,709
I don't understand...

83
00:08:50,179 --> 00:08:52,669
I do understand
how you feel, Dominüra.

84
00:08:55,049 --> 00:08:58,249
But I don't understand
why I understand.

85
00:09:02,929 --> 00:09:05,659
Because you're my pair... That's why.

86
00:09:15,469 --> 00:09:17,939
We should've realized it sooner.

87
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:21,009
So you're saying
the others were lured away?

88
00:09:21,109 --> 00:09:24,239
Yes.
They've splintered Chor Tempest...

89
00:09:24,349 --> 00:09:26,939
...forcing it
to disperse its combat power.

90
00:09:29,119 --> 00:09:31,609
It's going to be all right, Rimone.

91
00:09:32,219 --> 00:09:35,419
They still haven't
pinpointed our exact location.

92
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:36,929
Sibylla Dominüra...

93
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:40,889
I'm sure you're
as aware of this as I am.

94
00:09:40,999 --> 00:09:43,659
The sun will rise soon.

95
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:47,709
Once the enemy attacks again,
there'll be no escaping detection.

96
00:09:47,809 --> 00:09:51,899
In that case, what kind
of choices do we have?

97
00:09:52,349 --> 00:09:55,369
One would be to wait for
the four Simouns' return...

98
00:09:55,479 --> 00:10:00,249
...and sit tight until we can launch
a counterattack against the enemy.

99
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:01,909
The other would be...

100
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:05,789
...to make our escape from
this airspace as soon as possible.

101
00:10:07,489 --> 00:10:10,459
Then what will become
of Neviril and the others?

102
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,659
Well...

103
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:14,059
This is your opinion, is it not?

104
00:10:14,169 --> 00:10:19,499
As things stand, the survival rate for
the Simouns that have yet to return...

105
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:22,999
...is extremely low.

106
00:10:23,109 --> 00:10:25,669
How can you utter
such groundless rubbish?

107
00:10:25,779 --> 00:10:29,479
Chor Tempest is Kyuukoku's
finest chor! We can't fall!

108
00:10:29,579 --> 00:10:31,609
You're absolutely right.

109
00:10:31,719 --> 00:10:34,739
They're all coming back for sure.
So try to calm down.

110
00:10:37,989 --> 00:10:38,979
Paraietta!

111
00:10:40,329 --> 00:10:42,019
I'll search for the Simouns.

112
00:10:42,129 --> 00:10:43,929
What about the Messis?

113
00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:47,929
The captain's view about Shoukoku's
new aircraft attacking again...

114
00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:49,359
...isn't guaranteed!

115
00:10:49,569 --> 00:10:52,129
Your behavior is quite violent.

116
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:53,759
Rimone.

117
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:56,699
I want you to come with me.

118
00:10:56,809 --> 00:10:57,899
You and I...

119
00:10:58,009 --> 00:10:59,739
Rimone is my pair.

120
00:11:00,609 --> 00:11:02,079
Dominüra!

121
00:11:02,309 --> 00:11:04,939
And I am Rimone's pair.

122
00:11:12,859 --> 00:11:14,949
Why are you doing this?

123
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:21,489
What's going on with you? All of you!

124
00:11:21,969 --> 00:11:24,089
How can you stay so calm?

125
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:28,799
When your own
comrades are in peril?

126
00:11:29,409 --> 00:11:32,709
I could never bring myself
to abandon my comrades!

127
00:11:32,809 --> 00:11:36,369
You don't mean comrades.
You mean Neviril, don't you?

128
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,769
Since when is Neviril your underling?

129
00:11:39,889 --> 00:11:41,509
My underling?

130
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:45,109
Sibylla Aurea is
Chor Tempest's highest sibylla.

131
00:11:45,219 --> 00:11:47,619
Thinking someone
like you can protect her...

132
00:11:48,489 --> 00:11:49,979
...is gross arrogance.

133
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:56,489
Fine.

134
00:11:57,769 --> 00:11:59,429
I'll go with you.

135
00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:09,079
Rimone, you and I will go with them.

136
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:13,479
But give me a little time
before we leave. I won't be long.

137
00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:18,079
Besides, in the state
you're in right now...

138
00:12:18,189 --> 00:12:22,089
...you can't activate the Simoun
with Aer, can you, Paraietta?

139
00:12:46,489 --> 00:12:48,419
Sibylla Dominüra!

140
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:51,319
I see someone else got here first.

141
00:12:55,899 --> 00:12:57,949
Without something to believe in...

142
00:12:58,059 --> 00:13:01,619
...none of us can even
plant our feet on the earth.

143
00:13:01,729 --> 00:13:06,689
In my case, that was Kyuukoku,
as well as Tempus Spatium.

144
00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:15,409
What are you...

145
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:21,579
The Simouns taught me something...

146
00:13:21,889 --> 00:13:24,409
Something I never wanted to know.

147
00:13:24,989 --> 00:13:27,419
Please tell me...
What was it that you...

148
00:13:29,029 --> 00:13:31,549
What on earth did you...

149
00:13:32,059 --> 00:13:34,759
Forget about that day, Waporif.

150
00:13:35,069 --> 00:13:35,929
But...

151
00:13:37,069 --> 00:13:39,939
That's the last warning
I'll be giving you.

152
00:13:50,249 --> 00:13:51,609
As we thought.

153
00:13:52,849 --> 00:13:53,819
What is it?

154
00:13:53,889 --> 00:13:56,049
Planes sighted at eight o'clock!

155
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:00,889
They got here sooner than I thought.
We probably don't have time to run.

156
00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:06,659
The Messis will remain moored
here and attempt a counterattack!

157
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:09,559
Let's go, Aer.

158
00:14:09,669 --> 00:14:11,029
You all right?

159
00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:13,099
I want you, Aer.

160
00:14:13,969 --> 00:14:17,599
Because unless you come
with me, I can't save Neviril.

161
00:14:21,649 --> 00:14:23,509
Sibylla Dominüra...

162
00:14:24,749 --> 00:14:26,409
Please be safe.

163
00:14:26,889 --> 00:14:28,049
You too.

164
00:14:30,389 --> 00:14:31,519
Rimone?

165
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,259
I forgot to give it back!

166
00:14:51,009 --> 00:14:52,379
Do you see that?

167
00:14:52,479 --> 00:14:54,239
They're flying so high!

168
00:14:54,349 --> 00:14:56,579
They're practically Simouns!

169
00:15:11,599 --> 00:15:13,259
Dominüra! Rimone!

170
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,269
Aer, let's go! The Falcon Ri Majon!

171
00:15:26,549 --> 00:15:29,279
Aer! The Falcon
Ri Majon one more time.

172
00:15:29,849 --> 00:15:32,479
Right! As many times as it takes!

173
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:41,859
Rimone, which Ri Majon can we do
that has the most destructive power?

174
00:15:42,429 --> 00:15:44,729
The Wave Crest Ri Majon!

175
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:08,019
Rimone! One more time!

176
00:16:08,119 --> 00:16:10,209
Wave Crest Ri Majon!

177
00:16:13,929 --> 00:16:15,149
But why?

178
00:16:16,929 --> 00:16:18,089
How?

179
00:16:18,199 --> 00:16:22,189
They've made huge technological
advances in such a short time.

180
00:16:22,299 --> 00:16:26,099
They haven't reached the Simouns'
level yet, but such great numbers...

181
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,109
The Fish Silhouette Ri Majon!

182
00:16:32,779 --> 00:16:36,939
It's no good! We can't do
Ri Majons with all this interference!

183
00:16:39,319 --> 00:16:40,719
The Messis!

184
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:48,149
The Emerald Ri Majon...

185
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,899
Has the time come for us to do it?

186
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,259
But I don't know...

187
00:16:56,369 --> 00:16:57,359
Afraid?

188
00:16:57,469 --> 00:17:00,699
No, not me. But...

189
00:17:01,469 --> 00:17:03,769
You're afraid, aren't you, Dominüra?

190
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:08,939
Who ever thought you'd
understand me to that degree?

191
00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:12,279
What I saw that day...

192
00:17:12,379 --> 00:17:14,439
It was a terrifying sight.

193
00:17:17,159 --> 00:17:22,249
It destroyed every last shred of my
pride and shattered all I believed in.

194
00:17:22,929 --> 00:17:25,689
But that's not what I'm afraid of.

195
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:30,629
Beyond that terrible sight,
I caught a glimpse of something.

196
00:17:30,739 --> 00:17:32,569
That's what I'm afraid of.

197
00:17:32,669 --> 00:17:34,039
What was it?

198
00:17:34,969 --> 00:17:39,029
I can't describe it in words.
But if I had to give it a name...

199
00:17:40,109 --> 00:17:41,769
I'd call it hope.

200
00:17:43,819 --> 00:17:45,409
For the Messis...

201
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:48,539
They're fighting so
that we might be saved.

202
00:17:49,219 --> 00:17:51,119
They're fighting for us!

203
00:17:52,189 --> 00:17:53,319
Captain!

204
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:58,689
Don't let the sibyllae's
prayers be in vain!

205
00:17:59,199 --> 00:18:03,289
We'll draw the enemy's attention
so the priestesses can escape!

206
00:18:03,399 --> 00:18:04,489
Yes, sir!

207
00:18:11,779 --> 00:18:12,969
What the?

208
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:15,239
Madness! Are they trying to die?

209
00:18:15,349 --> 00:18:17,179
Are they doing it for us?

210
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:19,309
Yes, I'm sure they are.

211
00:18:25,989 --> 00:18:27,689
Prepare the cannons!

212
00:18:30,459 --> 00:18:31,589
Dominüra...

213
00:18:31,699 --> 00:18:32,599
Yes.

214
00:18:33,499 --> 00:18:35,019
I want to!

215
00:18:35,129 --> 00:18:37,189
No matter what may lie ahead?

216
00:18:37,899 --> 00:18:40,029
The Emerald Ri Majon.

217
00:18:45,239 --> 00:18:47,609
I guess we lost sight of them, huh?

218
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:48,869
I suppose.

219
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:54,279
What is this? This feeling?

220
00:18:54,749 --> 00:18:58,309
It feels so familiar
yet so relentlessly cold.

221
00:18:58,489 --> 00:18:59,749
Neviril!

222
00:19:00,129 --> 00:19:01,989
Over there... Look.

223
00:19:04,959 --> 00:19:06,059
That's...

224
00:19:06,329 --> 00:19:08,199
The Emerald Ri Majon!

225
00:19:20,149 --> 00:19:21,639
What's going on?

226
00:19:21,749 --> 00:19:23,739
Stop it, Dominüra! Rimone!

227
00:19:24,379 --> 00:19:26,319
You've got to stop!

228
00:19:26,419 --> 00:19:27,979
That's the Emerald...

229
00:19:31,959 --> 00:19:33,189
But why?

230
00:19:33,289 --> 00:19:36,349
Hold up, who's doing
the Emerald Ri Majon?

231
00:19:37,529 --> 00:19:40,829
I never thought
we'd ever see it again...

232
00:19:41,469 --> 00:19:43,259
We're heading right back!

233
00:19:43,369 --> 00:19:44,929
You're sure? That's...

234
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,129
No! They'll be killed!

235
00:19:48,139 --> 00:19:50,339
Stop it... please...

236
00:19:51,879 --> 00:19:55,609
Stop it!

237
00:20:02,689 --> 00:20:03,879
Rimone...

238
00:20:04,589 --> 00:20:06,109
Dominüra?

239
00:20:06,889 --> 00:20:08,449
I'm not afraid.

240
00:20:08,859 --> 00:20:11,519
Right, I'm not afraid either.

241
00:20:14,399 --> 00:20:15,829
We're together.

242
00:20:15,929 --> 00:20:17,299
Together...

243
00:20:19,669 --> 00:20:21,099
Forever and ever.

244
00:20:21,209 --> 00:20:23,469
Yes, forever and ever.

245
00:20:55,569 --> 00:20:57,669
Nothing's changed.

246
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:03,739
Wait. Where did
Dominüra and Rimone go?

247
00:21:03,849 --> 00:21:05,249
They're gone.

248
00:21:08,949 --> 00:21:10,889
They don't give up.

249
00:21:19,869 --> 00:21:21,089
Neviril...

250
00:21:21,529 --> 00:21:23,129
Captain! It's the Simouns!

251
00:21:23,239 --> 00:21:26,069
Thank goodness! They're all safe!

252
00:21:28,269 --> 00:21:30,469
Sibylla Dominüra...

253
00:21:34,249 --> 00:21:35,209
What's this?

254
00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:36,349
What's going on?

255
00:21:36,349 --> 00:21:37,679
What's going on?
Hey!

256
00:21:37,779 --> 00:21:39,339
C-Captain!

257
00:21:39,749 --> 00:21:42,949
Directly overhead...
I-It's the Arcus Prima!

258
00:21:51,629 --> 00:21:55,229
That was a close shave,
but it seems we're in time.

259
00:21:55,329 --> 00:21:58,599
Sorry to have kept
you waiting, my sibyllae.

260
00:22:00,969 --> 00:22:02,529
Everybody...

261
00:22:07,809 --> 00:22:11,309
I am Wauf, the captain of the Messis.

262
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,049
In the end, we survived.

263
00:22:14,849 --> 00:22:19,879
Thanks to the Arcus Prima and the
return of Chor Tempest's Simouns.

264
00:22:22,289 --> 00:22:28,129
But as for the Simoun flown by Sibylla
Dominüra and Sibylla Rimone...

265
00:22:28,499 --> 00:22:31,989
We never found
even the slightest trace.

266
00:22:41,379 --> 00:22:48,009
It is played by my wounds...
the song of prayer.

267
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:52,249
Let it ring out over
the grieving universe.

268
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:59,289
Can we change tomorrow?
Don't be afraid.

269
00:22:59,399 --> 00:23:07,029
I want to let you know
how my heart's overflowing.

270
00:23:15,779 --> 00:23:19,809
"I want to get closer to you."
"I want to feel your pulse."

271
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:24,979
I was too defiant,
and I took the long way around.

272
00:23:25,089 --> 00:23:28,989
The blue moon is swaying silently.

273
00:23:29,089 --> 00:23:32,759
My true heart's desire is you.

274
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:38,429
I can't reach you.
My tears of pain trickle down.

275
00:23:38,969 --> 00:23:44,409
Soar away into the sky, song of prayer.

276
00:23:44,509 --> 00:23:47,809
Carrying my love that came too late.

277
00:23:47,909 --> 00:23:53,509
What can I do to change tomorrow?

278
00:23:53,619 --> 00:23:59,749
Just hold on to "now" the way it is...

279
00:24:05,429 --> 00:24:06,829
To Be Continued

280
00:24:07,329 --> 00:24:12,789
Headed for the forbidden land, Chor
Tempest makes a startling discovery.

281
00:24:13,969 --> 00:24:15,709
Next time on Simoun...

282
00:24:15,709 --> 00:24:16,879
The Ruins

283
00:24:16,879 --> 00:24:18,209
The Ruins
The Ruins.

284
00:24:18,209 --> 00:24:20,109
The Ruins
