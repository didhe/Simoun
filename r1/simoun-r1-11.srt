1
00:00:00,444 --> 00:00:09,374
The countless flowers,
enveloped in light...

2
00:00:09,484 --> 00:00:20,094
...gaze at tomorrow
with unwavering eyes.

3
00:00:32,014 --> 00:00:38,974
Everyone wishes for me to be pure...

4
00:00:39,254 --> 00:00:46,384
...but what can I bring
with me to the frayed skies?

5
00:00:46,494 --> 00:00:53,554
What I've made my own
by breaking off flowers in bloom...

6
00:00:53,834 --> 00:00:59,134
All such sinful things...

7
00:00:59,234 --> 00:01:06,614
Why did I stop making
promises with the future?

8
00:01:06,714 --> 00:01:13,914
Because even if I try
to run far from all the pain...

9
00:01:14,024 --> 00:01:20,584
...a cold wind rustles
my hair... Don't you see?

10
00:01:20,694 --> 00:01:28,154
Where can I ever find the answer?

11
00:01:55,624 --> 00:01:58,794
I know they say,
"there's no place like home"...

12
00:01:58,894 --> 00:02:00,894
...but you're all so comfortable.

13
00:02:01,004 --> 00:02:03,934
It looks like some
still have a way to go.

14
00:02:06,474 --> 00:02:09,604
Oh, the young lady with
the charming new hairstyle.

15
00:02:20,454 --> 00:02:21,614
Boo!

16
00:02:22,324 --> 00:02:24,794
What's the matter, Roatreamon?

17
00:02:25,924 --> 00:02:29,294
Well, this bed seems
to be a little lopsided.

18
00:02:30,664 --> 00:02:33,794
It's not just your imagination, milady?

19
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:34,704
It's old.

20
00:02:34,704 --> 00:02:36,794
It's old.
You can put up with that much.

21
00:02:36,904 --> 00:02:39,374
But it really bothers me.

22
00:02:41,104 --> 00:02:44,904
It creaks if I move
just a little, and that bothers me.

23
00:02:45,474 --> 00:02:46,634
Hold this.

24
00:02:51,714 --> 00:02:53,814
Do you think you can...

25
00:02:57,854 --> 00:02:59,054
Here goes...

26
00:03:03,494 --> 00:03:04,754
Hurry up...

27
00:03:09,304 --> 00:03:10,494
How's that?

28
00:03:10,834 --> 00:03:12,134
You fixed it.

29
00:03:12,504 --> 00:03:14,374
Thank you, Mamina.

30
00:03:14,474 --> 00:03:17,064
Don't thank me
for something like this.

31
00:03:17,174 --> 00:03:18,944
What's with them?

32
00:03:19,044 --> 00:03:22,244
Who knows?
Something to do with that haircut?

33
00:03:30,654 --> 00:03:31,954
We're descending.

34
00:03:32,054 --> 00:03:34,424
Have we reached our destination?

35
00:03:53,014 --> 00:03:54,004
We've stopped.

36
00:04:03,524 --> 00:04:09,254
United Front

37
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:22,834
Man, what a piece of junk.
Where's the bridge?

38
00:04:22,944 --> 00:04:27,504
This is the priestesses' ship?
I imagined something better.

39
00:04:27,614 --> 00:04:29,444
Like a secret garden?

40
00:04:35,384 --> 00:04:36,684
Hey, look.

41
00:04:36,794 --> 00:04:38,254
Those are sibyllae?

42
00:04:38,354 --> 00:04:40,024
This is the first time I've seen one.

43
00:04:40,024 --> 00:04:41,194
This is the first time I've seen one.
Hey, you! Quit socializing.

44
00:04:41,194 --> 00:04:43,024
Hey, you! Quit socializing.

45
00:04:43,124 --> 00:04:44,224
Let's go.

46
00:04:47,004 --> 00:04:48,764
What's going on here?

47
00:04:49,364 --> 00:04:51,924
This ship has Simoun
sibyllae on board...

48
00:04:52,034 --> 00:04:56,034
We know. That's why we
went out of our way to join you.

49
00:04:56,144 --> 00:04:57,444
Out of your way?

50
00:04:57,444 --> 00:04:58,804
Out of your way?
Perfect timing.

51
00:04:58,914 --> 00:05:01,504
Can you take me to the bridge?

52
00:05:02,614 --> 00:05:05,274
I won't allow
such disrespect! We are...

53
00:05:05,384 --> 00:05:07,414
If you please... Come this way.

54
00:05:07,524 --> 00:05:08,354
Yun.

55
00:05:08,354 --> 00:05:10,014
Yun.
Just a minute.

56
00:05:10,124 --> 00:05:12,214
I will show them the way.

57
00:05:12,324 --> 00:05:13,414
This way.

58
00:05:13,524 --> 00:05:14,514
Neviril.

59
00:05:14,624 --> 00:05:16,094
Wait here, guys.

60
00:05:16,194 --> 00:05:17,284
Gotcha.

61
00:05:24,234 --> 00:05:27,174
Just as you'd expect from Neviril.

62
00:05:28,944 --> 00:05:33,174
Welcome to the Messis. First of all,
please make yourselves at home.

63
00:05:33,284 --> 00:05:37,584
Thank you, Captain.
But is this really going to work?

64
00:05:37,984 --> 00:05:43,944
The youngsters on board this ship
just don't look like they're up to battle...

65
00:05:44,124 --> 00:05:49,064
If battles could be won on the basis
of looks alone, I would abide by that.

66
00:05:49,324 --> 00:05:54,024
But the Simoun sibyllae
are the mainstay of our nation.

67
00:05:54,134 --> 00:05:56,434
That is an undeniable fact.

68
00:05:56,534 --> 00:06:00,524
All sides are watching as we
launch this historical campaign.

69
00:06:00,644 --> 00:06:03,334
There will be no room for failure.

70
00:06:03,444 --> 00:06:08,034
First and foremost, I believe it is
important that we trust each other.

71
00:06:09,214 --> 00:06:11,204
Yes, you're probably right.

72
00:06:11,314 --> 00:06:14,844
Then we've agreed
to go through with this?

73
00:06:14,954 --> 00:06:17,514
Of course.
We're counting on you too.

74
00:06:17,624 --> 00:06:18,854
Very well.

75
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,754
Explain, Dominüra.

76
00:06:22,864 --> 00:06:26,054
We're about to form
a united front with these soldiers.

77
00:06:29,234 --> 00:06:31,864
We're counting on you, Sibylla...

78
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,594
It's Neviril.

79
00:06:33,704 --> 00:06:35,904
Sibylla Neviril.

80
00:06:40,944 --> 00:06:42,714
A united front?

81
00:06:42,814 --> 00:06:46,804
Yes, it seems we'll be joining
forces with those men somehow.

82
00:06:47,624 --> 00:06:49,084
Us?

83
00:06:49,184 --> 00:06:51,124
With those people?

84
00:06:54,924 --> 00:06:57,454
Sibylla, you're so sweet!

85
00:06:58,564 --> 00:07:01,324
We're being dragged
down further and further.

86
00:07:02,164 --> 00:07:04,064
What'll become of us?

87
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:08,334
Well, a cramped ship getting
more cramped is a problem.

88
00:07:09,144 --> 00:07:12,114
Some people seem
to be enjoying themselves.

89
00:07:13,514 --> 00:07:16,914
Oh, for real?
You're from around here.

90
00:07:17,014 --> 00:07:20,414
Yes, I enlisted as
soon as this war began.

91
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:23,084
Good for you. You're an ally of justice.

92
00:07:23,554 --> 00:07:26,884
Then as a reward,
I'll show you around this ship.

93
00:07:28,724 --> 00:07:29,754
What's wrong?

94
00:07:29,864 --> 00:07:33,324
Uh, you see...
I shouldn't be touching a sibylla...

95
00:07:33,434 --> 00:07:35,424
It won't make any difference.

96
00:07:35,904 --> 00:07:40,164
We haven't gone to the Spring yet,
but that's the only difference.

97
00:07:41,844 --> 00:07:45,574
Don't worry... I'm going
to become a woman anyway.

98
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:48,164
T-That's not what I meant...

99
00:07:48,744 --> 00:07:52,704
Under normal circumstances,
a lowly enlisted man like me...

100
00:07:52,814 --> 00:07:55,014
...wouldn't dare speak to a priestess...

101
00:07:55,124 --> 00:07:59,184
I told you not
to make things so complicated!

102
00:07:59,594 --> 00:08:00,714
Let's go!

103
00:08:04,194 --> 00:08:07,534
The last few weeks,
enemy attacks have increased...

104
00:08:07,634 --> 00:08:11,594
...leaving us no choice but
to fall back from our defense lines.

105
00:08:11,704 --> 00:08:16,304
To keep the enemy from gaining more
ground, we'll launch an operation...

106
00:08:16,404 --> 00:08:20,934
...to reclaim this town here,
Urvel, their apparent target.

107
00:08:23,014 --> 00:08:24,774
It'll go down like this.

108
00:08:24,884 --> 00:08:28,654
First, we'll transport our troops
by using the Simoun planes.

109
00:08:28,754 --> 00:08:30,454
Transport? Us?

110
00:08:30,954 --> 00:08:35,794
Yes, we'll outfit the Simouns with
special transport armor to do it.

111
00:08:35,894 --> 00:08:37,954
The Simouns will transport soldiers?

112
00:08:38,464 --> 00:08:42,954
If there were another way, we'd do it.
Can you try to understand?

113
00:08:47,674 --> 00:08:53,114
The soldiers aboard will be deployed
to secret posts around the city.

114
00:08:55,544 --> 00:08:59,954
After which the main battalion
will push forward on my signal.

115
00:09:00,054 --> 00:09:03,614
We'll launch a pincer attack
and destroy the enemy.

116
00:09:04,554 --> 00:09:07,324
What else do you wish us to do?

117
00:09:07,424 --> 00:09:12,994
Leave the rest to us. Once you've
transported us, your job is done.

118
00:09:13,904 --> 00:09:18,234
The operation will start the night
of the new moon, tomorrow at 2300.

119
00:09:18,834 --> 00:09:22,034
Make sure you're all
in top form for this task.

120
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,234
Right.

121
00:09:24,244 --> 00:09:25,474
What?

122
00:09:25,974 --> 00:09:29,434
How could they do such
a thing to the Simouns?

123
00:09:29,544 --> 00:09:34,854
I'm not doing this to our divine
aircraft because I want to either.

124
00:09:34,954 --> 00:09:38,754
No way! Don't you feel
bad for the Simouns?

125
00:09:39,654 --> 00:09:42,324
And that thing...

126
00:09:43,424 --> 00:09:46,394
To tell you the truth, it's so lame!

127
00:09:48,404 --> 00:09:50,134
I'm telling you...

128
00:09:50,704 --> 00:09:53,224
The other day,
we were flying over the ocean.

129
00:09:53,334 --> 00:09:58,294
And we saw this huge fish, and I
thought, "That looks pretty tasty."

130
00:09:58,414 --> 00:10:01,974
You can tell she couldn't
care less about the rest of us.

131
00:10:02,084 --> 00:10:05,314
The way she's just about
throwing herself at him...

132
00:10:05,414 --> 00:10:08,684
Well, we might not be that different.

133
00:10:09,854 --> 00:10:14,854
When your back's to the wall, there's
no time to think of others' feelings.

134
00:10:14,964 --> 00:10:18,454
In an ideal world, we'd all
learn to understand each other...

135
00:10:18,564 --> 00:10:20,464
...just like those two.

136
00:10:22,564 --> 00:10:23,934
Is it good?

137
00:10:24,034 --> 00:10:26,334
Yes, quite delicious.

138
00:10:26,434 --> 00:10:27,964
Delicious?

139
00:10:28,074 --> 00:10:30,544
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

140
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:42,644
I can see I've been mistaken
about sibyllae all along.

141
00:10:42,754 --> 00:10:43,744
Mistaken?

142
00:10:43,854 --> 00:10:49,554
Yes, I thought sibyllae were holier,
those whom must never be violated...

143
00:10:52,834 --> 00:10:54,804
I thought you didn't talk much.

144
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,034
Are you disillusioned?

145
00:10:56,034 --> 00:10:58,294
Are you disillusioned?
No, totally the opposite!

146
00:10:58,404 --> 00:11:01,774
Because I'm talking to you like this.

147
00:11:01,874 --> 00:11:03,804
Yeah, I'm glad too.

148
00:11:13,084 --> 00:11:14,554
Floe.

149
00:11:15,154 --> 00:11:16,414
What is it?

150
00:11:16,524 --> 00:11:18,784
I hear you're friendly with a soldier.

151
00:11:18,894 --> 00:11:20,954
Yes, his name is Mastiff.

152
00:11:21,064 --> 00:11:23,254
Keep your standing in mind.

153
00:11:23,364 --> 00:11:24,594
Standing?

154
00:11:24,694 --> 00:11:27,794
We are priestesses
serving Tempus Spatium.

155
00:11:27,904 --> 00:11:30,094
Indiscretions should be avoided.

156
00:11:30,204 --> 00:11:33,074
That kind of talk's
so behind the times.

157
00:11:33,674 --> 00:11:35,804
I can't help it. I like him.

158
00:11:36,344 --> 00:11:39,604
Floe, I said you
shouldn't say things like that...

159
00:11:39,714 --> 00:11:42,514
We'll all go to
the Spring sooner or later.

160
00:11:42,614 --> 00:11:45,044
Then sibylla or soldier won't matter.

161
00:11:45,154 --> 00:11:46,814
Listen, Floe...

162
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:49,754
Jeez, I'll just quit being a sibylla then!

163
00:11:49,854 --> 00:11:52,154
Then it won't be a problem, right?

164
00:11:52,254 --> 00:11:53,554
Floe!

165
00:12:00,934 --> 00:12:02,794
What a headache...

166
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:24,514
Sorry to keep you waiting!

167
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,684
Still, is it all right?

168
00:12:29,794 --> 00:12:32,264
Yes, it's fine. Did I keep you waiting?

169
00:12:32,364 --> 00:12:33,354
No.

170
00:12:33,464 --> 00:12:35,664
Really, Mastiff! You're so sweet!

171
00:12:36,864 --> 00:12:38,704
Don't you want to get close?

172
00:12:38,804 --> 00:12:40,104
It's not that...

173
00:12:40,204 --> 00:12:41,264
Then...

174
00:12:47,544 --> 00:12:52,174
Sibylla Floe, you and
the others serve Tempus Spatium...

175
00:12:52,284 --> 00:12:54,214
...and are closest to God.

176
00:12:54,324 --> 00:12:57,444
I guess. Where did that come from?

177
00:12:57,554 --> 00:13:00,494
We too harbor
deep religious convictions.

178
00:13:00,594 --> 00:13:04,294
But rather than out of love
and respect for Tempus Spatium...

179
00:13:04,394 --> 00:13:07,954
...it's because we couldn't
go on if we didn't believe.

180
00:13:11,634 --> 00:13:14,434
What do you think of
this war we're fighting?

181
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:18,134
I don't like it. But we've
got to fight or we'll be killed.

182
00:13:18,244 --> 00:13:21,004
How do you feel about killing people?

183
00:13:30,284 --> 00:13:33,054
Then why did you enlist?

184
00:13:35,394 --> 00:13:39,454
I can't really explain it,
but everyone else enlisted...

185
00:13:40,804 --> 00:13:45,634
Tomorrow's operation is a campaign
to reclaim the city where I was born.

186
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:51,764
Mornings are very beautiful in Urvel.

187
00:13:53,214 --> 00:13:58,914
Especially the view from the top of
the tower in the center of the city...

188
00:13:59,014 --> 00:14:00,844
It's beyond compare.

189
00:14:02,654 --> 00:14:04,384
That's why I...

190
00:14:13,534 --> 00:14:16,054
It'll be all right, Mastiff.

191
00:14:16,164 --> 00:14:18,724
Because I'll protect you.

192
00:14:45,894 --> 00:14:47,524
Begin the operation!

193
00:14:47,634 --> 00:14:51,224
Let's go, men!
By the grace of Tempus Spatium!

194
00:14:51,334 --> 00:14:52,864
By the grace!

195
00:15:16,864 --> 00:15:21,354
We'll fly as close to the ground as
possible. Stay out of enemy sight.

196
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:27,374
We are banning Ri Majons till further
notice to avoid damaging facilities.

197
00:15:28,274 --> 00:15:32,434
After transport, disengage
containers and retreat northwest.

198
00:15:32,544 --> 00:15:33,604
Understood?

199
00:15:34,144 --> 00:15:35,404
Yes, sir!

200
00:15:42,124 --> 00:15:45,574
Simoun sibyllae,
we pray for your safe return.

201
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,794
I have to say they've become ugly.

202
00:15:58,434 --> 00:16:01,924
I can't wait to get rid of these things.

203
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,274
It's hard not to drop them.

204
00:16:04,644 --> 00:16:08,774
Yeah... I just hope Mastiff
doesn't run into any danger.

205
00:16:09,284 --> 00:16:13,014
Roatreamon,
that hairstyle of yours is so lovely.

206
00:16:13,114 --> 00:16:15,174
Thank you, Morinas.

207
00:16:15,284 --> 00:16:17,344
We'll see more of these.

208
00:16:17,454 --> 00:16:22,454
Rimone, this is a pivotal operation,
a springboard for future missions.

209
00:16:23,124 --> 00:16:25,464
You'll understand soon enough.

210
00:16:27,934 --> 00:16:30,564
So this is a front-line mission...

211
00:16:33,404 --> 00:16:35,934
We're almost at
the drop-off point, Paraietta.

212
00:16:36,044 --> 00:16:37,104
Right.

213
00:17:21,454 --> 00:17:23,354
So we're done already?

214
00:17:23,454 --> 00:17:26,154
That was a pretty quick operation.

215
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:28,384
I'll undock the containers.

216
00:17:28,494 --> 00:17:31,624
So you didn't like those things either.

217
00:17:31,734 --> 00:17:36,394
I guess. It's asking too much to even
pretend to like such awkward...

218
00:17:40,474 --> 00:17:41,534
What's this...

219
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:43,834
Flares. Have they spotted us?

220
00:17:43,944 --> 00:17:48,744
No, from the number, we should
assume it was a trap from the start.

221
00:17:48,844 --> 00:17:52,974
Not good. If so, then those
old guys will get ambushed!

222
00:17:53,084 --> 00:17:55,514
We'll go support them.
Understood, Aer?

223
00:18:10,634 --> 00:18:12,264
They set us up.

224
00:18:28,124 --> 00:18:29,184
Everyone, retreat!

225
00:18:29,184 --> 00:18:30,244
Everyone, retreat!
Yes, sir!

226
00:18:46,404 --> 00:18:49,674
Hey, they may be ugly,
but they can be useful.

227
00:18:49,774 --> 00:18:51,534
We'll keep up support.

228
00:18:51,644 --> 00:18:52,874
Okay.

229
00:18:54,044 --> 00:18:57,314
See that? We've got
holy priestesses on our side!

230
00:18:57,414 --> 00:18:59,904
Step it up, guys!

231
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:01,244
Right!

232
00:19:08,094 --> 00:19:10,564
That's right, Rimone... Keep going...

233
00:19:10,664 --> 00:19:11,924
Just keep going!

234
00:19:12,034 --> 00:19:13,724
Just keep going?

235
00:19:16,504 --> 00:19:19,064
What are you doing? Fire, Floe!

236
00:19:19,174 --> 00:19:21,604
Mastiff... Where's Mastiff?

237
00:19:21,704 --> 00:19:22,674
Floe!

238
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:25,034
Please, Alty, try to find him!

239
00:19:25,344 --> 00:19:26,974
We don't have time.

240
00:19:27,074 --> 00:19:28,204
Please!

241
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,494
What's wrong, Kaim? Fire!

242
00:19:41,564 --> 00:19:42,654
Kaim!

243
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,384
But, Para-sama...

244
00:19:44,494 --> 00:19:47,154
I can see...
I can see people down there!

245
00:19:48,434 --> 00:19:52,664
Pull it together. Don't dare bring any
more dishonor to the priestesses!

246
00:20:01,244 --> 00:20:04,114
Neviril, at this rate, they'll...

247
00:20:04,214 --> 00:20:06,944
A Ri Majon. Strike with a Ri Majon.

248
00:20:07,054 --> 00:20:10,744
I know. But a Ri Majon
would unleash too much force.

249
00:20:11,424 --> 00:20:14,884
Will you stand by and
let those men die, Neviril?

250
00:20:28,244 --> 00:20:30,574
The Ri Majon ban is lifted.

251
00:20:33,044 --> 00:20:35,014
Floe, the Iron Ri Majon!

252
00:20:35,114 --> 00:20:38,244
We can't! If we do,
it'll put Mastiff in danger!

253
00:20:38,354 --> 00:20:39,974
His city will be...

254
00:20:40,084 --> 00:20:42,484
If we don't, he'll die anyway!

255
00:20:45,154 --> 00:20:46,214
Floe!

256
00:20:51,934 --> 00:20:53,024
All right.

257
00:20:53,134 --> 00:20:54,924
This is a Ri Majon's power?

258
00:20:55,034 --> 00:20:58,004
Amazing... It's like ten tanks at once.

259
00:20:58,274 --> 00:21:01,174
We can make it...
We can make it now!

260
00:21:05,044 --> 00:21:07,844
Target is city plaza,
the enemy command center!

261
00:21:07,944 --> 00:21:09,474
Iron Ri Majon!

262
00:21:10,684 --> 00:21:11,844
Stop!

263
00:21:11,954 --> 00:21:13,114
I want...

264
00:21:15,684 --> 00:21:17,484
I want to protect Mastiff.

265
00:21:18,794 --> 00:21:20,284
To protect Mastiff!

266
00:21:29,334 --> 00:21:30,354
They did it!

267
00:21:30,464 --> 00:21:33,374
They blew up
the enemy command center!

268
00:21:39,814 --> 00:21:43,004
Could they really be
Tempus Spatium sibyllae...

269
00:21:43,114 --> 00:21:44,674
Simouns...

270
00:21:45,854 --> 00:21:48,474
Could that be Floe?

271
00:21:48,584 --> 00:21:52,454
All right! The priestesses
have cleared the way for us!

272
00:21:52,554 --> 00:21:54,524
Let's show what we're made of!

273
00:21:54,624 --> 00:21:55,924
Right!

274
00:21:58,434 --> 00:22:00,524
This battle... No...

275
00:22:01,204 --> 00:22:03,964
They can't be divine aircraft...

276
00:22:05,674 --> 00:22:06,764
They're...

277
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,474
The Simouns are...

278
00:22:09,474 --> 00:22:11,534
The Simouns are demons!

279
00:22:12,744 --> 00:22:14,874
Mastiff, what are you doing?

280
00:22:14,984 --> 00:22:18,714
You can't let children like that
take part in a war anymore!

281
00:22:19,284 --> 00:22:21,984
This war is ours to fight!

282
00:22:40,874 --> 00:22:47,504
It is played by my wounds...
the song of prayer.

283
00:22:47,614 --> 00:22:51,744
Let it ring out over
the grieving universe.

284
00:22:51,854 --> 00:22:58,774
Can we change tomorrow?
Don't be afraid.

285
00:22:58,894 --> 00:23:06,424
I want to let you know
how my heart's overflowing.

286
00:23:15,304 --> 00:23:19,264
"I want to get closer to you."
"I want to feel your pulse."

287
00:23:19,374 --> 00:23:24,474
I was too defiant,
and I took the long way around.

288
00:23:24,584 --> 00:23:28,484
The blue moon is swaying silently.

289
00:23:28,584 --> 00:23:32,424
My true heart's desire is you.

290
00:23:32,524 --> 00:23:38,364
I can't reach you.
My tears of pain trickle down.

291
00:23:38,464 --> 00:23:43,904
Soar away into the sky, song of prayer.

292
00:23:44,004 --> 00:23:47,334
Carrying my love that came too late.

293
00:23:47,434 --> 00:23:53,004
What can I do to change tomorrow?

294
00:23:53,114 --> 00:23:59,314
Just hold on to "now" the way it is...

295
00:24:05,754 --> 00:24:06,694
To Be Continued

296
00:24:06,694 --> 00:24:07,324
To Be Continued
Kaim and Alty have taken off on
a reconnaissance mission as a pair.

297
00:24:07,324 --> 00:24:11,024
Kaim and Alty have taken off on
a reconnaissance mission as a pair.

298
00:24:13,764 --> 00:24:15,094
Next time on Simoun...

299
00:24:16,504 --> 00:24:17,704
Sisters
Sisters.

300
00:24:17,704 --> 00:24:20,294
Sisters
